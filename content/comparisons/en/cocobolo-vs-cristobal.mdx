# Cocobolo vs. Cristóbal: Distinguished Premium Rosewoods

Costa Rica's dry forests host two of Central America's most valuable timber species: **Cocobolo** (_Dalbergia retusa_) and **Cristóbal** (_Platymiscium pinnatum_). Both produce stunning decorative wood prized by fine woodworkers worldwide, both are in the legume family (Fabaceae), and both face conservation threats—but they're surprisingly easy to distinguish once you know what to look for.

<Callout type="warning" title="Critical Conservation Distinction">
  **Cocobolo** = Critically Endangered (IUCN CR) + CITES Appendix II (trade
  restricted) + Small tree (15-25 m) **Cristóbal** = Near Threatened (IUCN NT) +
  No CITES listing + Large canopy tree (25-40 m) Cocobolo is vastly more
  threatened and faces international trade restrictions. Never harvest without
  proper permits.

### The Single Best Differentiator

<Callout type="success" title="🔑 Key ID Tip: Tree Size + Wood Color">
  **In the forest:** Cristóbal trees tower 40 m tall with straight
  trunks—cocobolo is a small, gnarly tree rarely exceeding 25 m. **In the
  workshop:** Cocobolo heartwood is unmistakable orange-red with black streaks
  and VERY oily—Cristóbal is purple-brown and less oily. If the tree is huge,
  it's not cocobolo. If the wood smells spicy-sweet and your hands are oily,
  it's cocobolo.
