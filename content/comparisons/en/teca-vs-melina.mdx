# Teak vs. Gmelina: The Plantation Timber Decision

Costa Rica's commercial forestry sector revolves around two dominant introduced species: **Teak** (_Tectona grandis_) and **Gmelina** (_Gmelina arborea_), known locally as **Teca** and **Melina**. Both are from Southeast Asia, both thrive in Costa Rica's climate, and both are widely planted—but they represent opposite ends of the timber investment spectrum.

<Callout type="info" title="The Fundamental Trade-off">
  **Teak** = Slow growth (20-25 years) + Premium wood + High value + Low
  maintenance **Gmelina** = Ultra-fast growth (5-8 years) + Soft wood + Lower
  value + Higher maintenance The choice depends entirely on your timeline,
  capital, labor availability, and market access.

## Key Identification Features

### Quick Visual Distinctions

| Feature       | Teak (Tectona grandis)                          | Gmelina (Gmelina arborea)                |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Leaves**    | Large (20-50 cm), rough, sandpaper texture      | Heart-shaped, soft, velvety underneath   |
| **Leaf Base** | Squared to heart-shaped                         | Distinctly heart-shaped (cordate)        |
| **Flowers**   | Small white, in large panicles (June-Aug)       | Small yellow-orange, tubular (Feb-Apr)   |
| **Fruit**     | Round papery capsules in clusters               | Fleshy yellow-orange drupes              |
| **Bark**      | Gray-brown, fibrous, furrowed vertically        | Pale gray, smooth when young, flaking    |
| **Trunk**     | Straight, thick (60-150 cm diameter at harvest) | Straight but thinner (30-50 cm diameter) |
| **Branching** | Self-pruning, few lower branches                | Branchy, requires pruning                |

### Seasonal Behavior

**Teak:**

- **Dry Season (Dec-April):** Completely deciduous—drops ALL leaves in peak dry season (Feb-March), stands completely bare 1-2 months
- **Leaf Flush:** Dramatic bright green new leaf flush at start of rains (April-May)
- **Flowering:** June-August during rainy season
- **Distinctive:** The bare-branch silhouette is unmistakable—nothing else looks like a teak plantation in March

**Gmelina:**

- **Dry Season:** Semi-deciduous—loses some leaves but never completely bare
- **Leaf Flush:** Less dramatic, more continuous
- **Flowering:** February-April (dry season flowering)
- **Distinctive:** Retains green canopy year-round even in Guanacaste

### The Critical Difference

**Teak:** Long-term, lower risk, premium product, predictable markets, minimal labor, patient capital

**Gmelina:** Short-term, higher risk, commodity product, volatile markets, intensive labor, quick returns (or losses)

---

## Growing Requirements

### Climate Suitability

**Teak REQUIRES:**

- **Distinct dry season** of 3-6 months (moisture stress triggers quality wood formation)
- Annual rainfall: 1,200-2,500 mm
- Temperature: 25-35°C average
- **Best zones:** Guanacaste, northern Puntarenas, Pacific slope
- **Poor performance:** Caribbean slope (too wet), high elevations (too cool)

**Gmelina TOLERATES:**

- Year-round rainfall OR distinct dry season (very adaptable)
- Annual rainfall: 1,500-4,500 mm (wide range!)
- Temperature: 20-35°C average
- **Best zones:** Everywhere in Costa Rica below 1,000 m elevation
- **Advantage:** Can grow where teak cannot (Caribbean, wet zones)

### Soil Requirements

**Teak:**

- Prefers deep, well-drained soils
- pH 6.5-7.5 (neutral to slightly alkaline)
- Tolerates clay but performs best in loams
- **WILL NOT** tolerate waterlogging
- Performs excellently on volcanic soils

**Gmelina:**

- Less soil-sensitive (more forgiving)
- pH 5.5-7.5 (wider range)
- Grows on poorer soils than teak
- Tolerates brief waterlogging
- **REQUIRES FERTILIZATION** on poor soils

---

## Management Requirements

### Teak: "Plant and Wait"

**Year 1-2:** Weed control critical (mow or herbicide around seedlings)  
**Year 3-5:** First pruning—remove lower branches to 2-3 m height  
**Year 8-10:** Second pruning—clear bole to 6-8 m; first thinning (remove 30-40% of trees)  
**Year 12-15:** Final pruning; second thinning  
**Year 20-25:** Harvest—select cutting of best trees or clear-fell

**Total labor input: LOW** (maybe 20-30 days/ha over 20 years)

### Gmelina: "Intensive Plantation Management"

**Year 1:** Weed control (critical!), fertilization (NPK), pest monitoring  
**Year 2:** Fertilization, pruning (remove lower branches), thin to 800-1,000 stems/ha  
**Year 3:** Fertilization, second thinning to 600-700 stems/ha  
**Year 4:** Final thinning to 400-500 stems/ha, pruning  
**Year 5-8:** Harvest—clear-fell entire plantation

**Total labor input: HIGH** (60-80+ days/ha over 8 years)

**Critical:** Gmelina REQUIRES fertilization and intensive weed control or growth slows dramatically

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### For Teak Plantations

❌ **Planting in areas without distinct dry season** → Poor wood quality, slow growth, disease  
❌ **Neglecting weed control in years 1-3** → Seedlings get outcompeted, growth stunted  
❌ **Over-thinning or under-thinning** → Affects trunk diameter and final volume  
❌ **Harvesting too early** (before year 20) → Significantly reduces value per cubic meter  
❌ **Planting on shallow soils** → Trees blow over, roots hit rock, poor growth

### For Gmelina Plantations

❌ **Skipping fertilization** → Growth rates collapse, harvest delayed, poor returns  
❌ **Inadequate pruning** → Knots reduce wood quality, lower prices  
❌ **Planting without market access secured** → Plantation ready but no buyer = financial disaster  
❌ **Ignoring weed control** → Gmelina is fast but weeds are faster in wet zones  
❌ **Harvesting too late** (after year 10) → Wood quality declines, rot begins, returns drop

## Final Thoughts: The Patience Premium

The choice between Teak and Gmelina is ultimately a choice between **patience and speed**, between **luxury and utility**, between **minimal labor and intensive management**.

**Teak** rewards those who can wait with premium prices and low effort. It's forestry for the long view.

**Gmelina** rewards those who work hard with quick returns but demands constant attention and market awareness.

Neither is "better"—they serve entirely different financial strategies, timelines, and risk tolerances. The best Costa Rican timber operations often include both, balancing quick Gmelina cash flow with long-term Teak wealth accumulation.

The real question isn't "Which should I plant?" but rather "What is my timeline, and what is my risk tolerance?"

<Callout type="warning" title="Market Volatility Alert">
  Gmelina markets can shift dramatically. Before planting, secure buyer
  agreements or verify pulp mill proximity. Teak markets are more stable but
  also more competitive. Research current market conditions before committing
  capital to either species.
