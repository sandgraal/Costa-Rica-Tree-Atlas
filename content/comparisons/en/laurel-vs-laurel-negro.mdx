# Laurel vs. Laurel Negro: Costa Rica's Timber Tree Twins

These two native Boraginaceae species share the "Laurel" name and are both prized timber trees, causing frequent confusion among farmers, foresters, and wood buyers. Both produce excellent furniture-grade wood, but they differ significantly in ecology, habitat, and wood characteristics. Knowing the difference matters for reforestation projects, timber value assessment, and agroforestry planning.

<Callout type="tip" title="The Domatia Test (Most Reliable!)">
  **Laurel**: Look for **swollen nodes on young twigs** that house ants—these
  ant domatia are unique to _Cordia alliodora_! **Laurel Negro**: Twigs are
  smooth with **no swollen nodes**. The heartwood is notably **darker** when
  cut.

## Key Identification Features

### 1. Twig Domatia (Most Diagnostic!)

**Laurel (_Cordia alliodora_):**

- **Swollen nodes (domatia)** at branch junctions house ant colonies
- These hollow swellings are visible on young twigs
- Ants protect the tree from herbivores
- Unique among Costa Rican Cordias!
- If you see ants entering swollen twig nodes = Laurel

**Laurel Negro (_Cordia megalantha_):**

- Twigs are smooth, **no swollen domatia**
- No ant association
- Normal cylindrical twigs throughout
- If twigs lack swellings = could be Laurel Negro

<Callout type="info" title="The Ant Test">
  Examine young twigs at branch junctions. If you see **swollen, hollow nodes**
  that ants enter and exit, you're looking at Laurel, not Laurel Negro!
</Callout>

### 2. Heartwood Color (Definitive When Cut)

**Laurel:**

- Heartwood: **Light brown, golden, or honey-colored**
- Sapwood: Pale, similar to heartwood
- Little contrast between heart and sapwood
- Beautiful but less distinctive than Laurel Negro

**Laurel Negro:**

- Heartwood: **Dark brown to nearly black** (hence "Negro")
- Sapwood: Pale cream (strong contrast!)
- Dramatic color contrast
- Premium price due to dark coloring

### 3. Leaf Size and Texture

**Laurel:**

- Leaves: 8-20 cm long, 3-8 cm wide (smaller)
- Texture: Rough above (scabrous), pubescent below
- Shape: Elliptic to ovate-lanceolate
- Tip: Pointed (acuminate)

**Laurel Negro:**

- Leaves: 15-30 cm long, 8-15 cm wide (**larger**)
- Texture: More pubescent, especially below
- Shape: Broadly elliptic to obovate
- Tip: Pointed but often broader

### 4. Habitat and Distribution

**Laurel:**

- **Wetter climates**: Coffee zones, humid lowlands
- Pioneer species in disturbed areas
- Both Caribbean and Pacific slopes
- Elevation: 0-1500m (higher range)
- Very common in agroforestry systems
- Nationwide distribution

**Laurel Negro:**

- **Drier to moist forests**: Pacific slope dominant
- More selective about habitat
- Primarily Guanacaste, Puntarenas, Pacific Alajuela
- Elevation: 0-1200m (lower maximum)
- Less common, often in remnant forests
- More restricted distribution

### 5. Conservation Status

**Laurel:**

- Status: **Least Concern**
- Commonly planted, extensively used in agroforestry
- No harvest restrictions
- Abundant seedlings available

**Laurel Negro:**

- Status: **Vulnerable (VU)**
- Overharvested for valuable timber
- Natural populations declining
- Harvest may require permits
- Conservation priority species

## When They Look Most Similar

- **Young trees**: Before domatia are well-developed, juveniles can look similar
- **Pacific moist forests**: Where ranges overlap, both may grow together
- **Dried leaves**: Fallen leaves without twig context are hard to distinguish
- **Lumber at market**: Without bark/leaves, wood identification requires expertise

<Callout type="warning" title="Market Caution">
  Be aware that Laurel Negro wood is sometimes marketed as "Laurel" to fetch
  premium prices, or vice versa. If buying timber, insist on species
  verification—the price difference can be significant!
</Callout>

## Ecological & Cultural Significance

### Laurel (_Cordia alliodora_)

- **Pioneer species**: Colonizes disturbed areas, helps forest regeneration
- **Coffee shade**: The preferred shade tree for coffee and cacao agroforestry
- **Ant mutualism**: Fascinating ecological partnership with ants
- **Economic value**: Provides income to farmers while growing with crops
- **Reforestation favorite**: Fast growth, easy propagation

### Laurel Negro (_Cordia megalantha_)

- **Old-growth indicator**: More common in mature forests
- **Premium timber**: Among the most valuable native woods
- **Conservation concern**: Vulnerable due to overharvesting
- **Cultural significance**: Traditional furniture wood of Guanacaste
- **Slower regeneration**: Less common in plantations
