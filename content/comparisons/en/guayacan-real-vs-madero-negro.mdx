## Planting Recommendations

### Guayacán Real: Ornamental Only ✓ (with patience)

**Plant For:**

- Ornamental value (spectacular blue flowers)
- Conservation (every tree planted helps species)
- Botanical interest (rare in cultivation)
- Generational legacy (grandchildren will see mature tree)
- Supporting endangered species

**NOT For:**

- Timber production (illegal + requires 100+ years)
- Quick results (painfully slow growth)
- Agroforestry (no nitrogen fixation, too slow)
- Marginal/degraded soils (needs good conditions)

**Growing Tips:**

- Buy nursery-grown seedlings (don't dig from wild!)
- Plant in full sun, well-drained soil
- Protect from frost in first years
- Water regularly until established
- Be patient - this is a multi-generational project
- Mainly for Pacific dry forest zones (Guanacaste)

**Long-term Value:**

- Increases property value (rare ornamental)
- Supports conservation of endangered species
- Educational value (show children the densest wood)
- Beautiful blue flowers once mature
- Living heirloom for future generations

### Madero Negro: HIGHLY Recommended ✓✓✓

**Plant For:**

- Living fences (best use - replace barbed wire)
- Coffee/cacao shade (industry standard)
- Nitrogen fixation (soil improvement)
- Livestock fodder (20-30% protein)
- Firewood production (sustainable)
- Reforestation (fast pioneer species)
- Erosion control (slopes, stream banks)
- Quick results (fence in 1-2 years!)

**How to Plant:**

1. **Get cuttings:** Take 1-2 m long hardwood branches
2. **Timing:** Plant at START of rainy season (May-June)
3. **Method:** Push cutting 30-50 cm into soil
4. **Spacing:** 1-2 m apart for fence, 3-4 m for shade
5. **Water:** First 2-3 months, then forget it
6. **Success rate:** 80-95% will root and grow

**Management:**

- Prune annually to maintain fence height
- Coppice every 1-2 years for fodder/firewood
- Allow some to grow as shade trees
- Cut branches for livestock during dry season
- Essentially zero maintenance required

**Economics:**

- Living fence costs: ~$200-500/km (cuttings + labor)
- Barbed wire fence: ~$2,000-3,000/km (posts + wire)
- **Save money + get nitrogen fixation + fodder + firewood!**
- Pays for itself in 1-2 years

## Key Takeaway

**Guayacán Real** = Plant for your great-grandchildren's great-grandchildren. Protect every existing tree. Appreciate the miracle of the densest wood on Earth. Enjoy the blue flowers. NEVER harvest commercially. This is a living treasure, not a timber crop.

**Madero Negro** = Plant today, use next year. The ultimate sustainable agroforestry solution. Cut it, it grows back stronger. Use it for everything. This is how forestry SHOULD work - fast, renewable, beneficial to soil, and economically practical.

One teaches patience and conservation. The other provides immediate, tangible benefits while restoring ecosystems. Both have their place in Costa Rican landscapes—understand the difference and choose wisely.
