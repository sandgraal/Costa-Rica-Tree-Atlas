## When They Look Most Similar

### Dry Season Without Flowers

Both are completely leafless and deciduous during dry season.

**Solution:** Check the bark - scrape a small area. Yellow inner bark = Corteza Amarilla. Gray throughout = Roble de Sabana.

### Young Trees

Juvenile trees may not show distinctive bark or size differences.

**Solution:** If flowering, color is diagnostic. If not, wait for flowers or check habitat.

### From a Distance

Both appear as deciduous trees with similar shape.

**Solution:** During flowering season, color is obvious even from kilometers away. Outside flowering, look for size difference.

**Size matters** - Roble de Sabana is notably larger and more imposing.

**Color is unmistakable** - If flowering, you cannot confuse gold vs. pink!

**Visit Costa Rica in March** - This is peak flowering season for both species. You'll see entire hillsides painted in yellow and pink.

**Check urban areas** - Roble de Sabana is planted everywhere. Corteza Amarilla is less common but worth seeking out.

## Conservation & Reforestation

Both species are excellent for reforestation:

### Corteza Amarilla:

- Dry forest restoration
- Erosion control on slopes
- Timber production (35-40 years)
- Drought-tolerant landscaping
- Bee forage

### Roble de Sabana:

- Most versatile native tree for planting
- Live fences in pastures
- Watershed protection
- Urban greening
- Agroforestry systems
- Windbreaks

Neither species is threatened (both Least Concern), but Corteza Amarilla habitat (dry forests) has been heavily cleared for agriculture, making reforestation efforts valuable.
