# Corteza Amarilla vs. Cortez Negro: Costa Rica's Trumpet Tree Twins

These two iconic flowering trees share the "Cortez" name, belong to the same family (Bignoniaceae), and put on Costa Rica's most spectacular floral displays during the dry season. When blooming, they're unmistakable—one covers hillsides in golden yellow, the other in vivid pink-purple. But outside of flowering season, telling them apart requires closer observation. Both are prized ornamental and timber trees found throughout the country.

<Callout type="tip" title="The Flower Color Test (During Bloom)">
  **Corteza Amarilla**: **Bright golden-yellow** trumpet flowers (March-April).
  **Cortez Negro**: **Vivid pink to purple** trumpet flowers (February-March).
  During flowering, identification is instant!

- Yellow markings in throat
- Tree appears pink/purple from distance
- Blooms: February-March (earlier in dry season)

<Callout type="success" title="During Flowering">
  This is the **easiest comparison** in the entire tree atlas! **Yellow flowers
  = Corteza Amarilla. Pink flowers = Cortez Negro.** That's it!
</Callout>

### 2. Tree Size

**Corteza Amarilla:**

- Height: 15-25 m (medium-sized)
- Trunk: Up to 60 cm diameter
- Crown: Rounded, moderately spreading
- More compact overall

**Cortez Negro:**

- Height: 20-35 m (**larger**)
- Trunk: Up to 100 cm diameter
- Crown: Broader, more spreading
- More impressive stature

### 3. Bark Characteristics

**Corteza Amarilla:**

- Color: **Yellowish-brown to tan** (hence "amarilla"!)
- Texture: Deeply fissured, rough
- Pattern: Vertical ridges, corky
- Inner bark: Yellow-brown

**Cortez Negro:**

- Color: **Gray to dark brown** (hence "negro"!)
- Texture: Less deeply fissured, smoother
- Pattern: More subtle ridges
- Inner bark: Pinkish to brown

<Callout type="info" title="Bark Color Memory Tip">
  **Amarilla** = Yellow = Yellowish bark **Negro** = Black/Dark = Darker gray
  bark The names hint at the bark color as well as the darkness of the wood!
</Callout>

### 4. Leaves (When Present)

**Both species** have palmately compound leaves with 5 leaflets (like a hand), but:

**Corteza Amarilla:**

- Leaflets: 5-12 cm long
- Margin: **Clearly serrated** (toothed edges)
- Texture: Somewhat rough above
- Hairiness: Slightly pubescent below

**Cortez Negro:**

- Leaflets: 6-15 cm long (slightly larger)
- Margin: **Entire to slightly serrated** (smoother edges)
- Texture: Smoother, more leathery
- Hairiness: Nearly glabrous (smooth)

### 5. Habitat and Distribution

**Corteza Amarilla:**

- **Pacific dry forest** specialist
- Primarily Guanacaste, Puntarenas
- Elevation: 0-800 m (lower range)
- Prefers defined dry season
- Less common at higher elevations

**Cortez Negro:**

- **Wider distribution** - both slopes
- Found nationwide including Caribbean
- Elevation: 0-1200 m (wider range)

## When They Look Most Similar

- **Outside flowering season**: Both are deciduous, leafless trees
- **Young trees**: Before bark character fully develops
- **Distant viewing**: Crown shapes can appear similar
- **Mixed plantings**: Sometimes planted together as "Cortez"

<Callout type="warning" title="Timber Market Note">
  Both species produce valuable hardwood. Cortez Negro wood (marketed as
  "Lapacho" or "Ipe") is especially valuable for outdoor applications due to
  exceptional durability. Make sure you know which species you're buying or
  selling!

## Ecological & Cultural Significance

### Corteza Amarilla

- **Dry forest indicator**: Strong association with Pacific dry forests
- **Pollinator magnet**: Bees, butterflies flock to yellow blooms
- **Photography subject**: Iconic dry season landscapes
- **Climate signal**: Blooming indicates peak dry season
- **Timber**: High-quality wood for furniture and construction

### Cortez Negro

- **Urban champion**: One of Costa Rica's favorite street trees

## Growing and Landscape Use

Both make excellent landscape trees, but:

**Corteza Amarilla:**

- Better for: Dry climate areas, smaller properties
- Space needed: 10-15 m radius
- Flowering: Peaks mid-dry season
- Character: More compact, garden-scale

**Cortez Negro:**

- Better for: Wider range of climates, larger properties
- Space needed: 12-18 m radius
