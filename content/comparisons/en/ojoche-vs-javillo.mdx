# Ojoche vs. Javillo: The Ultimate Safety Contrast

Two tall rainforest giants that share similar habitats and heights, but represent opposite extremes of the safety spectrum. One sustained Maya civilization for millennia; the other is nicknamed the "Dynamite Tree" and causes blindness.

<Callout type="warning" title="Critical Safety Distinction">
  **Ojoche** = EXCEPTIONALLY SAFE (edible superfood, child-friendly) **Javillo**
  = EXTREMELY DANGEROUS (toxic sap, explosive pods, fatal seeds) This is perhaps
  the most important tree ID you can learn in Costa Rica.
</Callout>

## The One-Second Safety Test

**Look for spines on the trunk:**

- **NO SPINES** → Likely Ojoche (SAFE - edible seeds)
- **COVERED IN SHARP CONICAL SPINES** → Javillo (DANGER - stay away!)

**Additional quick check - Look at the bark color:**

- **Smooth, light gray bark** → Ojoche (safe)
- **Gray-brown bark with spines like a medieval mace** → Javillo (danger)

## Critical Safety Differences

### Ojoche: The Safe Superfood Tree

**Why It's Safe:**

- **NO toxicity** - all parts completely non-toxic
- **Edible seeds** - nutritious superfood, fed Maya civilization for 3,000+ years
- **Safe to touch** - smooth bark, no spines, mild latex
- **Child-friendly** - excellent for schools, parks, playgrounds
- **Pet-safe** - livestock and animals can safely graze fallen seeds
- **No hazards** - no structural risks, no dangerous features

**Historical Evidence:**

### Javillo: The Danger Tree

**Why It's Dangerous:**

**1. CAUSTIC SAP (Immediate Blindness Risk):**

- Milky latex contains hurin and creptin (toxic proteins)
- Causes severe chemical burns on skin contact
- **Eye contact causes BLINDNESS** (temporary or permanent)
- Sap sprays when tree is cut or damaged
- Used historically as arrow poison for warfare

**2. EXPLOSIVE SEED PODS (Ballistic Hazard):**

- Pumpkin-shaped capsules explode with GUNSHOT sound
- Seeds launched at **250 km/h** (155 mph) - faster than baseball pitch
- Travel distances of **40-100 meters**
- Can cause serious injury to eyes, face, head
- Fruiting season (April-June) = danger zone beneath tree

**3. FATALLY TOXIC SEEDS (Poisoning Risk):**

- Seeds resemble edible nuts but are EXTREMELY TOXIC
- Just **1-2 seeds can be FATAL to children**
- Causes violent vomiting, diarrhea, nervous system damage
- Historically used as fish poison (kills all fish in pond)

**4. SHARP SPINES (Puncture Wounds):**

- Trunk covered in 1-5cm conical woody spines
- Present throughout tree's entire life
- Cause deep puncture wounds
- Cannot safely prune or trim

---

### Fruiting Season Diagnostic

**Ojoche (September-November):**

- Small round fleshy fruits (1-2 cm diameter)
- Yellow-orange when ripe
- Fall quietly to ground
- Contain single nutritious seed
- Safe to collect and eat
- Animals gather beneath tree to feed

**Javillo (April-June):**

- Large woody capsules (8-15 cm diameter)
- Pumpkin-shaped, segmented into 8-15 wedges
- **EXPLODE with loud bang**
- Seeds launch violently through air
- **STAY AWAY during fruiting season**
- Seeds toxic - do not touch or collect

## Key Takeaway

The most important tree identification you can learn in Costa Rica:

✅ **Smooth trunk = Ojoche = SAFE** (edible superfood, plant everywhere)  
❌ **Spiny trunk = Javillo = DANGER** (toxic, explosive, stay away)

When in doubt, observe from a distance and look for trunk spines. If you see spines, back away and assume it's dangerous. If the trunk is smooth, it's likely safe (but always verify with other features).

**Ojoche** deserves celebration and cultivation—a miracle tree that fed ancient civilizations and offers hope for food security in the 21st century.

**Javillo** deserves respect and caution—a reminder that nature's defenses can be spectacularly dangerous, and some trees simply don't belong near people.
