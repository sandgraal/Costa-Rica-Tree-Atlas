# Guanábana vs Anona: The Custard Apple Cousins

<Callout type="tip" title="Quick ID: Size is Everything">
  **Guanábana** produces HUGE spiny green fruits (2-5 kg) with soft flexible
  spines. **Anona** bears smaller scaly fruits (200-500g) with hard overlapping
  scales like reptile skin. Both taste amazing—guanábana is tangy-sweet, anona

## Overview

Both **Guanábana** (_Annona muricata_) and **Anona** (_Annona reticulata_) are prized Annonaceae fruit trees grown throughout Costa Rica for their custard-like white flesh. They're often confused because they share the distinctive creamy texture and are both called "annona" or "custard apple" in English. However, they differ significantly in fruit size, skin texture, flavor, and tree characteristics. Understanding these differences helps gardeners choose the right tree and shoppers select their preferred fruit.
