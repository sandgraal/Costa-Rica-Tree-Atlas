# Mango vs. Espavel: Cultivated and Wild Anacardiaceae

While both mango and espavel belong to the Anacardiaceae (cashew) family, they occupy completely different ecological niches in Costa Rica. Mango is the familiar cultivated fruit tree found in gardens and farms, while espavel is a majestic native forest giant that towers over riverbanks. Despite their family relationship, these trees are easy to distinguish once you know what to look for.

<Callout type="tip" title="The Size Test (Most Obvious)">
  **Mango**: Medium-sized cultivated tree (15-30m), dense rounded crown, found
  in gardens/farms, single large fleshy fruits. **Espavel**: Towering forest
  giant (40-50m), massive buttress roots extending several meters, grows along
  rivers, cashew-like fruits with nut attached to fleshy base.

## Key Identification Features

### 1. Tree Size & Structure (Most Diagnostic!)

**Mango:**

- Medium-sized tree: 15-30 m tall (occasionally to 40 m)
- **NO buttress roots** - straight single trunk
- Dense, rounded, symmetrical crown
- Trunk diameter: 50-100 cm
- Cultivated appearance - well-maintained, often pruned
- Typically found in open areas, gardens, farms

**Espavel:**

- **Forest giant**: 40-50 m tall (up to 60 m!)
- **MASSIVE buttress roots** extending 3-5 m up trunk and several meters outward
- Emergent crown towers above rainforest canopy
- Trunk diameter: Up to 200-300 cm
- Wild, natural appearance - unpruned, impressive stature
- Grows along rivers and streams in lowland forests

<Callout type="info" title="The Buttress Test">
  If you see **massive triangular buttress roots** extending like walls from the
  base of the tree, it's definitely an **Espavel** - mangoes never develop
  buttresses!
</Callout>

### 2. Habitat & Location

**Mango:**

- **Cultivated settings:** Gardens, yards, farms, plantations
- **Urban areas:** Streets, parks, landscaping
- **Elevation:** Sea level to 1,200 m (tolerates various conditions)

- **Riparian zones:** Along rivers, streams, floodplains
- **Elevation:** 0-800 m (lowland forests only)
- **Soil:** Alluvial soils, seasonally flooded areas
- **Location:** Deep forest, riverbanks
- **Human association:** Remote forests, protected areas

### 3. Fruit Structure

**Mango:**

- **Single large drupe** - the familiar mango fruit
- Oval to kidney-shaped, 10-25 cm long
- Hangs from stem on panicle
- Colors: Green, yellow, orange, red (various cultivars)
- Flesh surrounds large flat seed

- **Nut**: Kidney-shaped, 2-3 cm, attached at BASE of apple
- Apple is edible but not commonly eaten
- **Nut is edible** ONLY when properly roasted
- Raw nuts contain urushiol (toxic!)
- Important wildlife food source

### 4. Leaves

**Mango:**

- Lanceolate to oblong shape
- 15-30 cm long, 2-8 cm wide (narrow)

## Urushiol Warning - Both Trees Have It!

<Callout type="warning" title="Family Safety Concern: Urushiol">
  Both trees are in the Anacardiaceae family and contain **urushiol** - the same
  compound found in poison ivy. However, the risks differ significantly between
  the two species.
</Callout>

### Mango Urushiol Exposure

- **Location:** Highest in peel and sap
- **Fruit flesh:** Generally safe to eat
- **Sap contact:** Can cause skin rash in sensitive people
- **"Mango mouth":** Rash from eating unpeeled fruit
- **Risk level:** Moderate - most people tolerate mangoes

### Espavel Urushiol Exposure

- **Raw nut shell:** Contains urushiol (like cashew)
- **Sap/bark:** Contains irritating compounds
- **Roasting required:** Nuts must be roasted to destroy toxins
- **Cashew apple:** Generally safe
- **Risk level:** Moderate to high if handling raw nuts

### Safety Guidelines

1. **Wear gloves** when harvesting either species
2. **Peel mangoes carefully** - avoid skin contact with peel
3. **NEVER eat raw Espavel nuts** - roasting required
4. **Wash hands** after handling either tree
5. **Sensitive individuals:** Extra caution with both species
6. **Cross-reactivity:** If allergic to cashews, avoid Espavel nuts

## When Confusion Might Occur

### Situations Where They Might Be Confused:

1. **Young cultivated Espavel:** Occasionally planted as an ornamental (rare)
2. **Large old Mangoes:** Can appear massive but still lack buttresses
3. **Anacardiaceae family knowledge:** "Oh, they're related!" doesn't mean they look alike

### Easy Ways to Tell Them Apart:

1. **Check for buttress roots** - Only Espavel has them
2. **Look at habitat** - Cultivated garden vs. wild riverbank
3. **Measure tree height** - Espavel towers above mango
4. **Examine fruit structure** - Single mango vs. cashew-like structure
5. **Consider location** - Urban/farm vs. deep forest

## Ecological & Cultural Roles

### Mango

**Ecological Role:**

- Moderate wildlife value (fruit bats, birds eat fruit)
- Provides shade in agroforestry systems
- Widely cultivated for commercial fruit production

**Cultural Importance:**

- Beloved fruit tree throughout Costa Rica
- Important cash crop for small farmers
- Cultural significance in Asian and tropical regions
- Street tree in many towns and cities

**Uses:**

- Fresh fruit consumption (most important)
- Processed products (dried, juice, preserves)
- Wood occasionally used for crafts
- Shade and ornamental value

### Espavel

**Ecological Role:**

- **Keystone species** in riparian forests
- Critical food source for wildlife (agoutis, squirrels, birds, monkeys)
- Massive trees provide habitat for epiphytes and wildlife
- Buttress roots prevent riverbank erosion
- Emergent canopy provides nesting sites

**Cultural Importance:**

- Traditional food source (roasted nuts)
- Sacred to some indigenous communities
- Important indicator of healthy riparian ecosystems
- Symbol of old-growth forest

**Uses:**

- Edible nuts (traditional food)
- Limited timber use (wood is soft)
- Watershed protection (erosion control)
- Wildlife habitat conservation
- Ecotourism value (impressive trees attract visitors)

## Quick Visual ID Guide

### See Massive Buttress Roots?

- **YES** → Espavel (only Espavel has huge buttresses)
- **NO** → Continue checking

### Where is the Tree Growing?

- **Garden/Farm/Urban** → Likely Mango
- **Wild Riverbank/Forest** → Likely Espavel

### What's the Tree Height?

- **15-30 m with dense crown** → Likely Mango
- **40-50 m towering above canopy** → Definitely Espavel

### What Type of Fruit?

- **Single large mango fruit** → Mango
- **Cashew-like nut + apple** → Espavel

## Conclusion

While mango and espavel share membership in the Anacardiaceae family and both contain urushiol compounds, they are remarkably different trees occupying completely different niches:

**Choose Mango if you're looking at:**

- A cultivated fruit tree in a garden or farm
- A medium-sized tree with a dense rounded crown
- A tree with NO buttress roots
- A tree producing familiar mango fruits

**Choose Espavel if you're looking at:**

- A towering forest giant along a riverbank
- One of the tallest trees around with emergent crown
- A tree with MASSIVE triangular buttress roots
- A tree producing cashew-like fruits (nut + apple)

The most reliable field test: **Look for buttresses!** If you see massive buttress roots extending several meters from the base, you're looking at an Espavel. Mango never develops buttresses.
