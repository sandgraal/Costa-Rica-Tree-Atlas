# Mango vs. Marañón: Anacardiaceae Fruit Trees

Both mango and marañón (cashew) are beloved fruit trees in Costa Rica from the Anacardiaceae family. While experienced gardeners know them well, beginners often confuse them - both have similar leaves, both produce fleshy fruits, and **both contain urushiol compounds that can cause skin reactions**. Here's how to tell them apart.

<Callout type="warning" title="The Fruit Test (Most Obvious)">
  **Mango**: Single large oval/kidney-shaped fruit (green to red/yellow) hanging
  from a stem. Edible flesh surrounds a large flat seed. **Marañón (Cashew)**:
  Unique structure - fleshy "cashew apple" (yellow/red pear-shaped) with hard
  kidney-shaped nut attached at the bottom. Nut must be roasted before eating!

## Key Identification Features

### 1. Fruit Structure (Diagnostic!)

**Mango:**

- Single fleshy drupe fruit
- Familiar mango shape - oval to kidney-shaped
- Fruit hangs from stem
- Flesh (mesocarp) surrounds large flat seed
- Colors: green (unripe) to yellow/red/orange (ripe)
- One seed inside that is NOT eaten raw

**Marañón (Cashew):**

## Urushiol Safety - CRITICAL for Both Species

<Callout type="danger" title="Shared Safety Concern: Urushiol">
  Both trees contain **urushiol** (same compound in poison ivy) and can cause
  allergic contact dermatitis. Handle with care!
</Callout>

### Mango Urushiol Exposure

- **Skin (peel):** Highest concentration in peel/rind
- **Sap:** All parts have some urushiol when damaged
- **Fruit flesh:** Generally safe to eat (peel carefully)
- **"Mango Mouth":** Rash around mouth from eating unpeeled fruit
- **Severity:** Moderate - reactions less severe than cashew

### Marañón (Cashew) Urushiol Exposure

- **Raw nut shell oil:** EXTREMELY TOXIC - contains high urushiol concentration
- **Never eat raw nuts:** Can cause severe poisoning
- **Roasting required:** Traditional roasting removes toxic shell oil
- **Cashew apple:** Generally safe to eat (avoid contact with nut)
- **Severity:** HIGH - raw nut shell oil is dangerous

### Safety Tips

1. **Wear gloves** when harvesting or handling either tree
2. **Peel mangoes carefully** - don't let peel touch face
3. **NEVER eat raw cashew nuts** - only properly processed cashews
4. **Wash hands** after handling fruits or trees
5. **People sensitive to poison ivy** should exercise extra caution
6. **Cross-reactivity:** Allergic to one? May react to the other

## When They Look Most Similar

### Young Seedlings

- Both have alternate leaves
- Leaf shape not yet diagnostic
- **Solution:** Wait for fruit or check leaf tip shape (pointed vs. rounded)

### From a Distance

- Both are medium-sized trees with spreading crowns
- Leaf color can look similar
- **Solution:** Look for fruit structure if present, or check tree size (mango much larger)

### Without Fruit

- Both have similar flowering panicles
- Bark can look similar
- **Solution:** Check leaf shape (mango pointed, cashew rounded tip)

---

## Fruit Uses & Processing

### Mango

**Eaten Fresh:**

- Peel carefully (urushiol in skin!)
- Slice flesh away from flat seed
- Popular in smoothies, salads, desserts

**Processed:**

- Dried mango
- Mango juice/nectar
- Mango chutney
- Pickled green mango

### Marañón (Cashew)

**Cashew Apple:**

- Eaten fresh (sweet but astringent)
- Juice (popular in Costa Rica)
- Fermented into wine
- Jams and preserves

**Cashew Nut:**

- **Must be roasted:** Traditional roasting over fire removes toxic shell oil
- Commercially processed with careful safety protocols
- Cashew nuts sold in stores are always processed
- **NEVER attempt to eat raw cashews from tree**

## Quick Field Test

1. **Is there a kidney-shaped nut attached to the bottom of a fleshy fruit?**
   - YES → Marañón (Cashew)
   - NO → Mango

2. **Are the leaves rounded at the tip?**
   - YES → Marañón
   - NO (pointed) → Mango

3. **Is the tree very large (20-30+ m)?**
   - YES → Probably Mango
   - NO (8-15 m) → Probably Marañón

4. **Is the crown irregular and sprawling?**
   - YES → Marañón
   - NO (dense, rounded) → Mango

## Cultural & Economic Importance

### Mango

- **King of Fruits** - one of world's most popular
- Hundreds of varieties worldwide
- Major commercial crop in Costa Rica
- Fresh export market
- National fruit of India, Pakistan, Philippines

### Marañón (Cashew)

- **Two products:** Apple (local use) + nut (commercial)
- Cashew nut is valuable export commodity
- Traditional processing is skilled labor
- Cashew apple often underutilized (ferments quickly)
- Native to Brazil, now tropical worldwide

---

## Planting Considerations

### Mango

- **Space needed:** Large tree - plant 10-12 m from buildings
- **Water:** Moderate, drought-tolerant once established
- **Soil:** Adaptable, well-drained
- **Fruiting:** 3-5 years from seed, 2-3 years grafted
- **Pruning:** Essential for size control and fruit production

### Marañón

- **Space needed:** Smaller - plant 6-8 m from buildings
- **Water:** Low, extremely drought-tolerant
- **Soil:** Tolerates poor, sandy soil
- **Fruiting:** 3-4 years
- **Maintenance:** Low, naturally small
- **Processing expertise:** Need knowledge to process nuts safely

## Related Anacardiaceae Trees

Both are in the cashew family. Related Costa Rican species include:

- **Jobo** (_Spondias mombin_) - Yellow mombin, similar urushiol content
- **Jocote** (_Spondias purpurea_) - Red mombin
- **Maraño de montaña** (wild cashew relatives)

All share urushiol chemistry - handle with care!

## Tips for Beginners

**Look for the fruit first** - the double structure of marañón (apple + nut) is unmistakable.

**Check leaf tips** - pointed (mango) vs. rounded (marañón) is reliable year-round.

**Size matters** - mangos become very large trees; cashews stay smaller.

**Respect urushiol** - wear gloves when handling either species if you're sensitive to poison ivy.

**Don't eat raw cashew nuts** - this cannot be emphasized enough. Proper roasting is essential.
