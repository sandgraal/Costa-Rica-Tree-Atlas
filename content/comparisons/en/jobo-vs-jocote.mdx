# Jobo vs. Jocote: Costa Rica's Two Native Plums

These two native Spondias species share similar names, belong to the same genus, and both produce delicious tart plums—no wonder they're constantly confused! Both are essential living fence trees across Costa Rica, propagated by simply sticking large branches in the ground. At markets, vendors may call both "ciruela" (plum) adding to the confusion. Learning to tell them apart matters for farmers, fruit lovers, and anyone trying to identify trees along country roads.

## Key Identification Features

### 1. Tree Size (Most Obvious!)

**Jobo (_Spondias mombin_):**

- **Large tree**: 15-30 meters tall
- Trunk can reach 1 meter diameter
- Wide, spreading crown
- Forest tree or large shade tree
- Too big for typical backyard
- Often wild or semi-wild

**Jocote (_Spondias purpurea_):**

- **Small to medium tree**: 7-15 meters (usually 8-10 m)
- Trunk typically under 60 cm diameter
- More compact, manageable crown
- Perfect backyard fruit tree size
- Common in home gardens
- Extensively cultivated

<Callout type="info" title="The Quick Size Check">
  Is the tree **huge** (30m tall with massive trunk)? → **Jobo** Is it
  **modest-sized** (8-12m, manageable)? → **Jocote**
</Callout>

### 2. Fruit Color (Definitive When Fruiting!)

**Jobo:**

- Unripe: Green
- Ripe: **Bright yellow to golden orange**
- Flesh: Yellow, very tart, aromatic
- Texture: Fibrous around seed
- Best use: Beverages, preserves (too tart for most to eat plain)

**Jocote:**

- Unripe: Green ("jocote verde" - eaten with salt!)
- Semi-ripe: Yellow to orange
- Ripe: **Red to dark purple** ("jocote maduro")
- Flesh: Sweeter than jobo, less fibrous
- Best use: Fresh eating, dried, candied

### 3. Leaflet Characteristics

**Jobo:**

- **9-19 leaflets** per compound leaf
- Leaflets **larger**: 5-10 cm long
- Margins: **Entire (smooth)** - no teeth
- Aromatic when crushed
- More widely spaced leaflets

**Jocote:**

- **9-25 leaflets** per compound leaf (more numerous)
- Leaflets **smaller**: 2-5 cm long
- Margins: **Serrated (toothed)** - look closely!
- Arrangement: More crowded on rachis
- Less aromatic

### 4. Fruiting Season

**Jobo:**

- Fruits: **May through August**
- Mid to late rainy season
- Fruits when tree is fully leafed out
- Yellow fruits visible from distance

**Jocote:**

- Fruits: **March through May**
- Early rainy season (first "aguaceros")
- Often fruits while still mostly leafless!
- Dramatic sight: bare branches covered in fruit

### 5. Habitat Preference

**Jobo:**

- Prefers **moister** conditions
- Riverbanks, humid lowlands
- Forest edges, disturbed areas
- Both coasts but more common Caribbean side
- Tolerates brief flooding

**Jocote:**

- Thrives in **drier** conditions
- Dry forest champion (Guanacaste!)
- Pastures, living fences, roadsides
- Very drought tolerant
- Primarily Pacific slope

## When They Look Most Similar

- **Young trees**: Before size difference becomes obvious
- **Out of fruit**: Without fruit color, harder to distinguish
- **Dry season**: Both drop leaves, look like bare sticks
- **At markets**: Fruits may be mislabeled; vendors say "ciruela"
- **Living fences**: Both propagated by large branch cuttings

<Callout type="warning" title="Market Tip">
  Vendors may call both fruits "ciruela" (plum). **Yellow plums** in mid-year =
  Jobo. **Red/purple plums** in March-May = Jocote. Price differs—jocotes are
  typically more valued culturally!
</Callout>

---

## Urushiol Note: Both in the Cashew Family!

<Callout type="info" title="Family Connection">
  Both Jobo and Jocote belong to **Anacardiaceae** (cashew/mango family) and
  contain **urushiol** in their sap—the same compound found in poison ivy.
  However, the **fruits themselves are safe to eat**!
</Callout>

### Safety for Both Species:

- **Fruit flesh**: Safe and delicious!
- **Sap contact**: May cause mild rash in sensitive individuals
- **Handling**: Most people have no issues
- **"Mango mouth"**: If you react to mango skin, be cautious with these skins
- **Overall risk**: Low—millions eat these fruits daily

---

## Cultural Significance

### Jobo in Costa Rica

- Less culturally prominent than jocote
- More of a "wild fruit" foraged from forests
- Traditional use in beverages and fermented drinks
- Important wildlife food (hence "hog plum")
- Living fence tree like jocote

### Jocote in Costa Rica

- **Iconic cultural fruit** - Ticos LOVE jocotes!
- Seasonal anticipation ("ya vienen los jocotes!")
- Eaten at all ripeness stages:
  - **Verde**: Green, with salt and lime (sour!)
  - **Sazón**: Half-ripe, sweet-tart
  - **Maduro**: Fully ripe, sweet purple
- Festival foods, traditional drinks (chicha de jocote)
- **Living fences** line roads throughout Guanacaste
- Symbol of Costa Rican countryside

---

## Growing Tips

### Both Species:

- **Propagation**: Large branch cuttings (1-2m stakes) stuck in ground
- **Success rate**: 70-90% if planted at start of rainy season
- **Spacing**: 3-5m apart for living fences
- **Maintenance**: Minimal - among easiest fruit trees!

### Key Differences:

| Aspect           | Jobo                         | Jocote                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Space needed** | Large—needs room to grow big | Small—fits in gardens               |
| **Water needs**  | Moderate                     | Low—very drought tolerant           |
| **Best for**     | Large properties, rural      | Backyards, living fences, anywhere! |
| **Fruit use**    | Beverages, preserves         | Fresh eating, all preparations      |
