## What is a Habitat?

A habitat is where an organism naturally lives - its home address in nature. It's not just a physical location but a complete package of environmental conditions including climate, soil, water, light, and other organisms that an organism needs to survive.

## Components of a Habitat

### Physical Factors (Abiotic)

**Climate:**

- Temperature range
- Rainfall patterns
- Humidity levels
- Seasonal variations

**Geography:**

- Elevation
- Slope and aspect
- Soil type and depth
- Water availability

**Light:**

- Sun exposure (full, partial, shade)
- Day length
- Light intensity

### Biological Factors (Biotic)

**Other organisms:**

- Food sources
- Pollinators
- Seed dispersers
- Competitors
- Predators/herbivores
- Symbiotic partners (mycorrhizae)

## Costa Rican Tree Habitats

### Dry Tropical Forest (Guanacaste)

**Conditions:**

- 6-month dry season
- High temperatures
- Low annual rainfall (1000-1500mm)
- Deciduous adaptation

**Characteristic trees:**

- Guanacaste (_Enterolobium cyclocarpum_)
- Pochote (_Pachira quinata_)
- Indio Desnudo (_Bursera simaruba_)

### Rainforest (Caribbean lowlands)

**Conditions:**

- Year-round rain (4000-6000mm)
- High humidity (80-100%)
- Constant warmth
- Evergreen dominance

**Characteristic trees:**

- Almendro (_Dipteryx panamensis_)
- Ceiba (_Ceiba pentandra_)
- Espavel (_Anacardium excelsum_)

### Cloud Forest (Monteverde, Poás)

**Conditions:**

- 1500-2500m elevation
- Constant mist and fog
- Cool temperatures (10-20°C)
- Epiphyte abundance

**Characteristic trees:**

- Aguacatillo (wild avocados)
- Oak species (_Quercus_ spp.)
- Tree ferns

### Mangrove (Coastal wetlands)

**Conditions:**

- Saltwater/brackish water
- Tidal flooding
- Anaerobic mud
- Extreme specialization

**Characteristic trees:**

- Red mangrove (_Rhizophora mangle_)
- Black mangrove (_Avicennia germinans_)
- White mangrove (_Laguncularia racemosa_)

## Habitat Specificity

### Generalist Species

**Broad habitat tolerance:**

- Can grow in multiple habitats
- Wide elevation range
- Flexible water needs
- Cosmopolitan distribution

**Example**: Balsa (_Ochroma pyramidale_)

- Found 0-1800m elevation
- Various soil types
- Pioneer in many habitats

### Specialist Species

**Narrow habitat requirements:**

- Specific elevation range
- Particular soil needs
- Limited geographic range
- Vulnerable to habitat loss

**Example**: Magnolia (_Magnolia poasana_)

- Cloud forests only
- 1500-2500m elevation
- Cool, misty conditions
- Endemic to Costa Rica

## Habitat Loss and Fragmentation

### Threats

**Deforestation:**

- Agriculture expansion
- Cattle ranching
- Urban development
- Logging

**Fragmentation:**

- Isolated forest patches
- Loss of connectivity
- Edge effects
- Reduced viable populations

### Consequences

**For trees:**

- Loss of pollinators
- Reduced seed dispersal
- Genetic isolation
- Increased extinction risk

**For ecosystems:**

- Biodiversity loss
- Disrupted services
- Climate impacts
- Water cycle changes

## Habitat Restoration

### Strategies

**Reforestation:**

- Plant native species
- Match species to habitat
- Create habitat corridors
- Restore ecosystem functions

**Protection:**

- National parks
- Biological reserves
- Private reserves
- Payment for Ecosystem Services

## Microhabitats

### Within a Forest

Different microhabitats exist at different levels:

**Canopy:**

- Full sun
- Wind exposure
- Lower humidity
- Epiphyte habitat

**Understory:**

- Deep shade
- High humidity
- Protected from wind
- Young tree nursery

**Forest floor:**

- Deep shade
- Leaf litter
- Decomposition zone
- Seedling germination

## Choosing Trees for Restoration

### Match Species to Habitat

**Know your site:**

1. Measure elevation
2. Test soil (pH, drainage)
3. Track rainfall patterns
4. Assess sun exposure
5. Identify nearby natural forests

**Select appropriate species:**

- Native to region
- Adapted to elevation
- Compatible with soil
- Match water requirements
- Consider successional stage

## Habitat vs. Range vs. Niche

| Concept | Definition               | Example                    |
| ------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Habitat | Where it lives           | Cloud forest               |
| Range   | Geographic distribution  | Costa Rica & Panama        |
| Niche   | Ecological role it plays | Canopy emergent, bird food |

## Climate Change Impacts

### Shifting Habitats

**Rising temperatures:**

- Habitats move upslope
- Cloud forests shrinking
- Lowland species move higher
- Mountaintop species have nowhere to go

**Altered rainfall:**

- Dry seasons lengthening
- Rainforest stress
- Species composition changing
- Some habitats disappearing

## Why It Matters

Understanding habitats helps with:

- **Species selection**: Plant right tree in right place
- **Conservation**: Protect critical habitats
- **Restoration**: Recreate natural conditions
- **Prediction**: Anticipate climate change impacts
- **Biodiversity**: Preserve habitat diversity

## Field Recognition

**Identify habitat type by:**

- Tree species composition
- Canopy structure
- Epiphyte abundance
- Soil moisture
- Leaf litter depth
- Presence of indicator species

## Take Action

**Protect habitats:**

1. Support protected areas
2. Create habitat corridors
3. Plant native trees
4. Restore degraded areas
5. Reduce deforestation
6. Support sustainable land use
7. Monitor and document habitats
