## What is a Petiole?

The petiole is the leaf's "stem" - the slender stalk connecting the broad leaf blade to the branch. Think of it as the leaf's handle, allowing it to position itself for sunlight while channeling water and nutrients.

## Structure and Function

### Anatomy

**Components:**

- **Vascular bundles**: Xylem (water up) and phloem (sugars down)
- **Cortex**: Support tissue
- **Epidermis**: Protective outer layer
- **Pulvinus**: Swollen base (in some species) allowing leaf movement

### Functions

1. **Support**: Holds leaf blade away from stem
2. **Transport**: Conduit for water, nutrients, sugars
3. **Positioning**: Orients leaf to optimize light
4. **Movement**: Allows leaves to track sun or fold at night
5. **Protection**: Can abscise (drop) under stress

## Variation in Petioles

### Length

**Long petioles** (5-30+ cm):

- Large-leaved trees (Ceiba, Balsa)
- Allow leaves to avoid overlapping
- Flutter in wind (cooling, pest deterrent)

**Short petioles** (0.5-2 cm):

- Smaller leaves
- More rigid attachment
- Less movement

**Sessile** (no petiole):

- Leaf blade attaches directly to stem
- Less common in trees
- Example: Some eucalyptus

### Shape

**Cylindrical**: Round in cross-section (most common)
**Flattened**: Wide and flat (allows twisting in wind)
**Winged**: Expanded margins (transition to compound leaves)
**Grooved**: Channeled upper surface (directs water)

## Special Features

### Color

- **Green**: Photosynthetic
- **Red/Purple**: Anthocyanin pigments (young growth, stress)
- **Brown**: Woody, mature

### Texture

- **Smooth**: Glabrous
- **Hairy**: Pubescent (insect deterrent, water retention)
- **Spiny**: Defense against herbivores

### Glands

Some species have **extrafloral nectaries** on petioles:

- Secrete nectar
- Attract protective ants
- Example: Many Acacia species

## Costa Rican Examples

### Ceiba (_Ceiba pentandra_)

- Very long petioles (20-30 cm)
- Palmate leaf with 5-9 leaflets
- Allow huge leaves to catch wind without damage

### Guanacaste (_Enterolobium cyclocarpum_)

- Bipinnate compound leaf
- Multiple orders of petioles (rachis, petiolules)
- Complex branching structure

### Balsa (_Ochroma pyramidale_)

- Long, thick petioles (15-25 cm)
- Support massive heart-shaped leaves
- Hollow, lightweight construction

## Petiole vs. Similar Structures

| Structure | Function           | Location          | Example         |
| --------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Petiole   | Leaf stalk         | Leaf to stem      | Most trees      |
| Petiolule | Leaflet stalk      | Leaflet to rachis | Compound leaves |
| Rachis    | Central axis       | Compound leaves   | Pinnate leaves  |
| Stem      | Main support       | Plant body        | All plants      |
| Pedicel   | Flower/fruit stalk | Flower/fruit      | Flowering trees |

## Identification Value

### Quick ID Features

**Petiole characteristics help identify trees:**

1. **Length**: Proportional to leaf size
2. **Color**: Red petioles often indicate young growth
3. **Glands**: Presence/absence is diagnostic
4. **Scars**: After leaves fall, petiole scars remain (useful in winter ID)

### Leaf Arrangement

Petiole attachment determines leaf arrangement:

- **Alternate**: One petiole per node, spiral pattern
- **Opposite**: Two petioles per node, paired
- **Whorled**: Three+ petioles per node (rare in trees)

## Seasonal Changes

### Abscission

In deciduous trees, petiole base forms **abscission layer**:

1. Cells weaken at petiole base
2. Leaf falls leaving clean scar
3. Tree seals wound with cork
4. Protects from pathogens and water loss

### Petiole Scars

After leaf drop, characteristic scars remain:

- Shape: Round, oval, crescent
- Size: Proportional to petiole
- Vascular bundle scars: Dots within scar
- Used for winter tree ID

## Why It Matters

Understanding petioles helps with:

- **Tree identification**: Characteristic lengths and features
- **Compound vs. simple leaves**: Petiolules indicate compound
- **Leaf arrangement**: Visible attachment patterns
- **Seasonal ID**: Petiole scars in winter
- **Pruning**: Cut location affects healing

## Field Tips

**Examine petioles for:**

1. Length relative to blade
2. Color and texture
3. Any glands or stipules
4. Shape in cross-section
5. Attachment pattern (alternate, opposite)
