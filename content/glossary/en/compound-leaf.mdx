## Visual Description

A compound leaf consists of **multiple leaflets** attached to a single leaf stem (petiole). Each leaflet looks like a small leaf, but all leaflets together form one functional leaf.

### How to Identify

**Key Test**: Look for the **axillary bud**. A true leaf has a bud where it attaches to the branch. Leaflets do NOT have buds at their attachment points.

### Types of Compound Leaves

**Pinnately Compound**

- Leaflets arranged along both sides of a central axis (rachis)
- Looks like a feather
- Example: Walnut, Ash, Guanacaste

**Palmately Compound**

- Leaflets radiate from a single point
- Looks like fingers on a hand
- Example: Horse Chestnut, Ceiba, Buckeye

**Bipinnate (Twice-Compound)**

- Each leaflet is itself divided into smaller leaflets
- Very complex appearance
- Common in Mimosaceae family

## Why It Matters

Compound leaves offer several advantages:

- **Reduced wind resistance**: Leaflets can move independently
- **Efficient water shedding**: Rain drips off easily
- **Flexible light capture**: Individual leaflets can adjust position
- **Reduced herbivore damage**: Loss of one leaflet doesn't destroy entire leaf

## Common Confusion

**Is it a compound leaf or a branch with simple leaves?**

Look for:

- **Buds**: Only present at base of true leaves, not leaflets
- **Arrangement**: Leaflets typically more uniform in size
- **Attachment**: All leaflets fall together as one unit

## Examples in Costa Rica

**Pinnately Compound:**

- Guanacaste (_Enterolobium cyclocarpum_)
- Mahogany (_Swietenia macrophylla_)
- Poró (_Erythrina poeppigiana_)

**Palmately Compound:**

- Ceiba (_Ceiba pentandra_)
- Pochote (_Pachira quinata_)
