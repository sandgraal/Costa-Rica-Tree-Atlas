## What is a Nurse Tree?

A nurse tree is a species that creates favorable conditions for the establishment of other, often more valuable or shade-tolerant species. By providing shade, wind protection, improved soil, and sometimes mycorrhizal connections, nurse trees accelerate forest recovery.

## How Nurse Trees Help

1. **Shade**: Reduce temperature extremes and photo-inhibition stress on seedlings.
2. **Moisture**: Lower evapotranspiration under the canopy, keeping soil moist.
3. **Wind protection**: Buffer young trees from desiccating or damaging winds.
4. **Soil improvement**: Add organic matter and fix nitrogen (in legumes).
5. **Mycorrhizal networks**: Share fungal connections that transfer nutrients to seedlings.

## Costa Rican Examples

### Guarumo (_Cecropia obtusifolia_)

The classic nurse tree — colonizes gaps rapidly, providing shade that allows slower-growing species like Almendro and Guapinol to establish beneath it before it is eventually overtopped.

### Madero Negro (_Gliricidia sepium_)

Nitrogen-fixing legume widely used in reforestation as a nurse species for cacao, coffee, and valuable timber species.

### Pochote (_Pachira quinata_)

Used in mixed plantations to shelter slower-growing mahogany and cedar seedlings from direct sun and wind.

## Nurse Trees in Reforestation

Costa Rican reforestation programs commonly use nurse tree strategies:

- **Plantation enrichment**: Plant pioneers first, then introduce target species beneath them.
- **Living fences**: Border plantings that shade and protect adjacent restoration zones.
- **Temporal sequence**: Nurse trees are allowed to grow 1–2 years before target species are interplanted.

## Practical Significance

- **Lower mortality**: Seedling survival rates can double under nurse tree canopy.
- **Faster succession**: Nurse trees compress decades of natural succession into years.
- **Economic efficiency**: Cheaper than artificial shade structures in large-scale restoration.
