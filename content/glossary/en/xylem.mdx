## What is Xylem?

Xylem is the tree's water-transport system and is what we commonly call "wood." It carries water and dissolved minerals from the roots up to the leaves — sometimes over 60 meters in tall tropical emergents.

## How It Works

### Key Components

1. **Vessel elements**: Wide, open tubes that carry large volumes of water quickly (found in hardwoods).
2. **Tracheids**: Narrow, elongated cells that transport water more slowly (dominant in softwoods/conifers).
3. **Xylem parenchyma**: Living storage cells within the wood.
4. **Xylem fibers**: Thick-walled cells that provide structural strength.

### Transport Mechanism

Water moves upward through the xylem by **transpiration pull** — evaporation from leaves creates negative pressure that draws water up through the continuous water columns. Cohesion between water molecules keeps the columns intact.

## Sapwood vs. Heartwood

- **Sapwood**: Outer xylem that actively transports water — lighter in color.
- **Heartwood**: Inner xylem that no longer transports water — filled with extractives, often darker and more durable.

## Costa Rican Examples

### Teca (_Tectona grandis_)

Large vessels produce efficient water transport, contributing to its fast growth in plantations.

### Cocobolo (_Dalbergia retusa_)

Dense xylem with abundant extractives creates the spectacularly colored, extremely hard heartwood prized worldwide.

## Why It Matters

- **Timber properties**: Xylem structure determines wood density, hardness, and workability.
- **Tree physiology**: Xylem damage from drought or disease can cause branch dieback.
- **Identification**: Vessel patterns visible under magnification help identify wood species.
