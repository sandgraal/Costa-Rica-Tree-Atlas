technicalDefinition: "A leaf apex that forms a sharp point with an angle between 45 and 90 degrees at the tip. The sides converge relatively quickly to form a distinct point. Distinguished from acuminate (prolonged, drawn-out point, angle &lt;45°) and obtuse (blunt point, angle &gt;90°). One of the most common apex types in tropical trees."

## What is Acute?

An acute apex is a leaf tip that forms a sharp point with an angle between 45-90 degrees. Not as drawn-out as acuminate, but sharper than obtuse. Think of a moderate point—distinctly sharp but not elongated.

## Identifying Acute Apexes

### Key Features

1. **Sharp point**: Distinctly pointed (not rounded)
2. **Angle 45-90°**: Moderate angle at tip
3. **Quick convergence**: Sides come together fairly rapidly
4. **Not drawn out**: Point isn't elongated
5. **Common form**: Very frequent in tropical trees

## Comparison with Similar Apexes

### Apex Types by Angle

**Acuminate:** &lt;45° (very sharp, drawn-out point)
**Acute:** 45-90° (sharp point, moderate angle)
**Obtuse:** &gt;90° (blunt, rounded point)
**Rounded:** No point, smoothly curved

## Visual Measurement

### The Angle Test

1. Look at leaf tip straight-on
2. Estimate angle where edges meet
3. Less than 45° → **Acuminate**
4. Between 45-90° → **Acute**
5. More than 90° → **Obtuse**

Use a protractor for precision, or estimate with folded paper (45° = perfect diagonal, 90° = right angle).

## Costa Rican Examples

**Guanacaste** (_Enterolobium cyclocarpum_):

- Leaflets with acute apexes
- Bipinnate leaves
- National tree

**Laurel** (_Cordia alliodora_):

- Acute to acuminate apex
- Important timber species
- Variable tip form

**Many Mango** (_Mangifera indica_):

- Acute apex common
- Lanceolate leaves
- Fruit tree

**Jobo** (_Spondias mombin_):

- Leaflets acute-tipped
- Pinnate compound leaves
- Native fruiting tree

## Why Acute Matters

### Identification Value

**Species diagnostic:**

- Acute vs acuminate can separate species
- Some species consistently acute
- Family patterns exist

**Quick field check:**

- Easy to assess visually
- No microscope needed
- Useful sorting character

## Common Mistakes

**Don't confuse:**

- Acute with acuminate (check if angle &lt;45° or drawn out)
- Acute with obtuse (check if angle &gt;90°)
- Juvenile with mature leaves (apex can change)
- Damaged tip with natural form

**Remember:**

- Acute = 45-90° angle
- Check multiple leaves on same tree
- Look at healthy, undamaged tips
- Use reference examples

## Field Recording

### Notation

**Precise:**

- "Apex acute" (45-90° angle)
- "Apex shortly acute" (closer to 90°)
- "Apex acute to acuminate" (variable, 30-75°)

**Complete description:**
"Leaves simple, elliptic, 8-12 cm long, margins entire, apex acute, base cuneate, glabrous on both surfaces."

## Why It Matters

Understanding acute apexes helps with:

- **Tree identification**: Diagnostic feature
- **Species comparison**: Distinguishing similar species
- **Age assessment**: Apex form can vary with maturity
- **Botanical accuracy**: Precise terminology
- **Field guide use**: Standard descriptive language
