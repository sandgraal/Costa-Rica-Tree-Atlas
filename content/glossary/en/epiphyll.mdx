## What is an Epiphyll?

An epiphyll is a tiny organism — usually a moss, liverwort, or lichen — that grows directly on the surface of a living leaf. These miniature gardens on leaves are a signature feature of Costa Rica's cloud forests and wet lowland rainforests.

## How They Establish

1. Spores or fragments land on a leaf surface.
2. High humidity and low light in the forest understory allow colonization.
3. Epiphylls grow slowly, forming thin crusts, patches, or tiny cushions.
4. They absorb moisture and nutrients from rain, mist, and leaf leachates.

## Common Types

- **Liverworts**: Flat, ribbon-like growths — the most common epiphylls.
- **Lichens**: Crust-like patches of green, grey, or orange.
- **Algae**: Thin green films, especially on large, long-lived leaves.
- **Mosses**: Small cushions, less common as epiphylls than as epiphytes.

## Effects on the Host Tree

- **Light reduction**: Heavy epiphyll cover can block 10–20% of photosynthetically active light.
- **Drip-tip adaptation**: Many tropical leaves have elongated tips that channel water and reduce epiphyll establishment.
- **Leaf lifespan**: Trees may drop heavily colonized leaves sooner.

## Costa Rican Context

### Cloud Forests

Monteverde and other montane forests are epicenters of epiphyll diversity — nearly every understory leaf hosts communities.

### Lowland Rainforest

Epiphylls are abundant but less diverse, favoring the largest, longest-lived leaves in deep shade.

## Why It Matters

- **Biodiversity**: Epiphyll communities are a hidden layer of forest diversity.
- **Indicator**: Abundance indicates high humidity and intact forest conditions.
- **Leaf evolution**: The drip-tip leaf shape common in tropical trees likely evolved partly to shed epiphylls.
