## What is a Tree Crown?

The **crown** is the leafy top of a tree - everything above the trunk including all the branches and leaves. It's where photosynthesis happens and where most wildlife activity occurs.

## Crown Characteristics

**Shape matters:**

- **Spreading**: Wide, umbrella-like (Guanacaste, Cenízaro)
- **Columnar**: Narrow, upright (some palms, conifers)
- **Rounded**: Dome-shaped (many oaks)
- **Pyramidal**: Cone-shaped when young (many conifers)
- **Vase-shaped**: Opens upward (American Elm)
- **Weeping**: Drooping branches (willows)

**Size:**

- **Crown width**: Horizontal spread, often measured
- **Crown depth**: Vertical extent from top to first branch
- **Crown ratio**: Crown length ÷ total tree height
- **Crown density**: Amount of light blocked by foliage

## Crown Functions

**Photosynthesis**: Solar panels capturing sunlight
**Water regulation**: Transpiration cools tree and moves water
**Habitat**: Shelter, nesting, food for wildlife
**Protection**: Shades roots and understory
**Reproduction**: Flowers and fruit typically in crown

## Forestry Importance

**Crown class** (how trees compete for light):

1. **Emergent**: Tower above canopy (Ceiba, Almendro)
2. **Dominant**: Full sunlight from above and sides
3. **Codominant**: Full sun above, crowded on sides
4. **Intermediate**: Shaded from sides, some sun from above
5. **Suppressed**: Completely shaded, struggling

**Crown health indicators:**

- **Full crown**: Healthy tree, good vigor
- **Sparse crown**: Stress, disease, or old age
- **Dead branches**: Dieback, indicates problems
- **Asymmetric**: Wind damage, competition, or lean
- **Discolored**: Nutrient deficiency, pest, or disease

## Practical Applications

**Urban forestry:**

- Crown clearance from buildings (10-15 feet minimum)
- Pruning to reduce wind resistance
- Crown raising for clearance below
- Crown thinning to reduce weight

**Agriculture:**

- Shade tree selection based on crown shape
- Coffee, cacao need specific light levels
- Silvopasture: Crown spacing for grass below
- Alley cropping: Narrow crowns preferred

## Costa Rican Examples

**Iconic crowns:**

- **Guanacaste**: Massive spreading crown, 30m+ wide
- **Ceiba**: Emergent, umbrella-shaped, 40m+ tall
- **Cenízaro**: Wide, flat-topped canopy
- **Almendro**: Tall emergent with broad crown

**Crown adaptations:**

- Dry forest species: Wide crowns maximize light capture
- Rainforest species: Narrow crowns compete for gaps
- Pioneer species: Fast-growing, light crowns
- Mature forest: Dense, deep crowns
