## What are Epiphytes?

Epiphytes are plants that grow on other plants (usually trees) but are not parasites. They use their host only for physical support, obtaining water and nutrients from rain, air, and organic debris that collects around them.

### Common Types

**Bromeliads**

- Tank-type collect water in central rosette
- Common on Costa Rican forest trees
- Provide habitat for frogs and insects

**Orchids**

- Spectacular flowers attract pollinators
- Aerial roots absorb moisture
- Costa Rica has 1,400+ orchid species

**Ferns**

- Often grow in branch crotches
- Collect organic matter in root masses
- Create micro-ecosystems

**Mosses and Lichens**

- Smallest epiphytes
- Cover branches and trunks
- Indicators of air quality

## Ecological Role

**Biodiversity Support**

- Increase habitat complexity
- Provide food for animals
- Create water reservoirs in canopy

**Nutrient Cycling**

- Capture nutrients from rainfall
- Release nutrients as they decompose
- Enrich the forest ecosystem

**Water Storage**

- Collect and store rainwater
- Moderate humidity in canopy
- Provide drinking water for animals

## Host Trees in Costa Rica

Some trees are particularly favored by epiphytes:

- **Almendro**: Large horizontal branches support diverse epiphyte communities
- **Ceiba**: Rough bark provides good attachment sites
- **Oak species**: Host over 100 epiphyte species per tree in cloud forests

## Fun Facts

- A single large tree can host over 100 epiphyte species
- Epiphytes make up about 10% of all plant species worldwide
- They're particularly abundant in tropical rainforests like Costa Rica's
