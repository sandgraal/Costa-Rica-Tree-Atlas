## What is Phenology?

Phenology is the calendar of a tree's life — when it flowers, sets fruit, drops leaves, and flushes new growth. In Costa Rica, these events are tightly linked to the wet/dry seasonal cycle rather than temperature changes.

## Key Phenological Events

1. **Leaf flush**: Production of new leaves, often at the start of the wet season.
2. **Flowering**: Can occur in dry season (many ornamentals) or wet season.
3. **Fruiting**: Follows flowering; fruit maturation time varies from weeks to months.
4. **Leaf fall**: Deciduous species shed leaves in the dry season to conserve water.
5. **Dormancy**: Reduced metabolic activity during dry season.

## Tropical Phenology in Costa Rica

### Dry Forest (Guanacaste)

- **January–April**: Deciduous trees lose leaves; many species flower on bare branches.
- **May–June**: First rains trigger synchronized leaf flush and seed germination.
- **Corteza Amarilla** blooms spectacularly in March–April on leafless branches.

### Wet Forest (Caribbean Lowlands)

- Less pronounced seasonality; flowering and fruiting more staggered.
- Some species fruit year-round.

### Cloud Forest (Monteverde)

- Mist and epiphyte loads obscure seasonal patterns.
- Many species flower during the brief dry period (January–March).

## Why It Matters

- **Pollinator management**: Knowing bloom times ensures pollination success in agroforestry.
- **Seed collection**: Phenological tracking identifies optimal harvest windows.
- **Wildlife**: Fruiting phenology determines food availability for birds and mammals.
- **Climate change**: Shifting phenology is an early indicator of climate impacts.
