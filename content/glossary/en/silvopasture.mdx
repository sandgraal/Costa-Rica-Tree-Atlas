## What is Silvopasture?

Silvopasture intentionally combines trees, forage (grass or legumes), and livestock on the same piece of land. It is one of the most productive and environmentally beneficial agroforestry systems, widely practiced in Costa Rica.

## How It Works

### System Components

1. **Trees**: Provide shade, fodder, timber, fruit, or nitrogen fixation.
2. **Forage**: Grasses and ground-cover legumes grow beneath and between trees.
3. **Livestock**: Cattle, sheep, or goats graze the forage and benefit from tree shade.

### Tree Arrangements

- **Scattered trees**: Individual trees retained in open pasture (most common in Guanacaste).
- **Tree rows**: Planted in lines with grazing between rows.
- **Intensive silvopasture**: Dense plantings of shrubs (e.g., _Leucaena_) with scattered timber trees.

## Benefits

- **Animal welfare**: Shade reduces heat stress; milk production can increase 10–20%.
- **Carbon sequestration**: Trees store carbon both above and below ground.
- **Soil health**: Tree roots prevent compaction; leaf litter adds organic matter.
- **Income diversification**: Timber, fruit, and fodder alongside livestock products.
- **Biodiversity**: Pasture trees support birds, bats, and beneficial insects.

## Costa Rican Examples

### Guanacaste Dry Forest

Scattered Guanacaste (_Enterolobium cyclocarpum_) trees in pastures provide massive shade canopies; cattle preferentially rest beneath them during midday heat.

### Intensive Silvopasture (CATIE Model)

The Tropical Agricultural Research and Higher Education Center (CATIE) in Turrialba has demonstrated intensive silvopasture systems that double or triple the carrying capacity of traditional pastures.

## Why It Matters

- **Climate-smart agriculture**: Silvopasture is recognized by the IPCC as a key climate mitigation strategy.
- **Land-use efficiency**: Produces more per hectare than separate forestry and livestock systems.
- **Payments for ecosystem services (PES)**: Costa Rica's PES program incentivizes silvopasture adoption.
