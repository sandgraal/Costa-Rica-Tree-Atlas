## What is Trifoliate?

A trifoliate leaf is a type of compound leaf with exactly three leaflets. It's one of the simplest compound leaf patterns and easy to recognize.

## Structure

### Three Parts

- **Central leaflet**: Usually largest, at the tip
- **Two lateral leaflets**: On sides, slightly smaller
- **Common petiole**: Stalk connecting all three to branch

## Recognition

Look for the "three-leaf pattern":

1. Count leaflets (must be exactly 3)
2. Check for shared petiole
3. Look for petiolules on each leaflet
4. Observe symmetry (may be even or uneven)

## Common Trifoliate Trees

### Tropical Examples

**Poison Ivy relatives** (_Toxicodendron_):

- Classic "leaves of three" warning
- Contains urushiol allergen

**Costa Rican Trifoliates:**

**Jobo** (_Spondias mombin_):

- Compound pinnate with occasional trifoliate sections
- Deciduous tree with yellow fruits

**Marañón/Cashew** (_Anacardium occidentale_):

- Some specimens show trifoliate tendencies
- Part of Anacardiaceae (poison ivy family)

## Similar Patterns

### Trifoliate vs. Other Patterns

| Pattern    | Leaflets | Arrangement       |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| Trifoliate | 3        | From one point    |
| Pinnate    | 5+       | Along central rib |
| Palmate    | 5-7      | Like hand fingers |
| Bifoliate  | 2        | Rare in trees     |

## Why It Matters

Understanding trifoliate leaves helps with:

- **Identification**: Narrow down species quickly
- **Safety**: Recognize toxic plants (poison ivy)
- **Botanical families**: Common in Fabaceae
- **Evolution**: Shows leaf simplification patterns

## Field Tips

**Quick ID Check:**

1. Count to three
2. Check for compound structure
3. Look for small petiolules
4. Note if all from same point

**Common Mistakes:**

- Confusing with three separate simple leaves
- Counting partially open pinnate leaves
- Missing small fourth leaflet
