## What is Air Drying?

Air drying (or air seasoning) is the traditional method of drying freshly cut timber by stacking it outdoors or in open sheds, allowing air to naturally remove moisture over time.

## The Air Drying Process

### Steps

1. **Milling**: Tree cut into lumber immediately after felling
2. **Stacking**: Boards stacked with 1-inch spacers between each layer
3. **Protection**: Covered roof prevents rain, sides open for airflow
4. **Waiting**: Months to years depending on thickness and species
5. **Monitoring**: Regular moisture meter checks until target reached

### Drying Timeline

**Rule of Thumb**: One year per inch of thickness

- 1-inch boards: 6-12 months
- 2-inch boards: 1-2 years
- 4-inch beams: 2-4 years
- Dense hardwoods: Add 50% more time

## Costa Rican Hardwood Air Drying

### Fast-Drying Species (6-12 months)

- **Melina** (_Gmelina arborea_): Plantation timber, dries quickly
- **Cedro** (_Cedrela odorata_): Aromatic cedar, stable drier

### Medium-Drying Species (1-2 years)

- **Laurel** (_Cordia alliodora_): Premium furniture wood
- **Pochote** (_Pachira quinata_): Lightweight tropical hardwood

### Slow-Drying Species (2-4 years)

- **Teca/Teak** (_Tectona grandis_): Dense, oily, premium timber
- **Cocobolo** (_Dalbergia retusa_): Extremely dense rosewood
- **Guayacán** (_Guaiacum sanctum_): Heaviest commercial wood

## Advantages

- **Low cost**: No energy required
- **Traditional**: Proven method for centuries
- **Gentle**: Less stress on wood, fewer defects
- **Preserves color**: Better color retention than kiln drying
- **Rural accessible**: No electricity needed

## Disadvantages

- **Slow**: Takes months to years
- **Weather dependent**: Humidity affects drying rate
- **Space intensive**: Requires large storage areas
- **Insect risk**: Beetles and termites can attack
- **Uneven**: Exterior dries faster than interior

## Why It Matters

Understanding air drying helps with:

- **Timber purchasing**: Know why air-dried costs less
- **Building projects**: Plan ahead for lumber availability
- **Wood quality**: Recognize differences from kiln-dried
- **Sustainability**: Air drying uses no fossil fuels
- **Local economy**: Small sawmills use air drying exclusively
