## What is Lanceolate?

Lanceolate describes narrow, spear-shaped leaves that are widest near the base and taper gradually to a long, pointed tip. This is one of the most common leaf shapes in trees worldwide.

## Identifying Lanceolate Leaves

### Key Features

1. **Narrow and elongated**: Length 3-6 times the width
2. **Widest below middle**: Broadest point in lower third
3. **Tapered ends**: Both base and apex taper to points
4. **Smooth outline**: Usually with entire or finely toothed margins

## Similar Shapes

### Related Forms

- **Oblanceolate**: Reverse lanceolate (widest above middle)
- **Linear-lanceolate**: Very narrow, almost grass-like
- **Ovate-lanceolate**: Broader, transitional to oval

## Costa Rican Trees with Lanceolate Leaves

### Laurel (_Cordia alliodora_)

Classic lanceolate leaves 10-15 cm long, smooth and glossy. The lance shape makes them instantly recognizable.

### Yellow Oleander (_Cascabela thevetia_)

Narrow lanceolate leaves 8-15 cm long, arranged spirally. CAUTION: Highly toxic species.

### Various Willows

Introduced willow species (_Salix_) in highland areas have the characteristic narrow lanceolate leaves.

## Adaptations

Lanceolate leaves offer several advantages:

- **Wind resistance**: Narrow shape reduces drag
- **Water shedding**: Pointed apex channels rain off leaf
- **Heat dissipation**: Less surface area prevents overheating
- **Desiccation resistance**: Reduced water loss in dry conditions

## Why It Matters

Understanding lanceolate leaves helps with:

- **Rapid identification**: Very distinctive shape
- **Habitat indication**: Common in riparian and dry environments
- **Distinguishing species**: Leaf width ratios aid ID
- **Ecological adaptation**: Shows environmental responses
