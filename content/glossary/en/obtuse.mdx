technicalDefinition: "A leaf apex that forms a blunt point or rounded tip with an angle greater than 90 degrees at the apex. The sides converge slowly or not at all, creating a broad, rounded termination. Distinguished from acute (sharp point, 45-90°), acuminate (drawn-out point, &lt;45°), and rounded (no point, completely curved). Common in species adapted to reduce water loss or mechanical stress."

## What is Obtuse?

An obtuse apex is a blunt or rounded leaf tip with an angle greater than 90 degrees. It's not sharply pointed like acute or acuminate—think of it as a gently rounded or blunt end.

## Identifying Obtuse Apexes

### Key Features

1. **Blunt tip**: Not sharply pointed
2. **Angle >90°**: Broad angle at apex
3. **Slow convergence**: Sides come together gradually or barely
4. **Rounded appearance**: May grade into "rounded" apex
5. **Not abrupt**: Smooth transition to tip

## Comparison with Similar Apexes

### Apex Types by Angle

**Acuminate:** &lt;45° (very sharp, prolonged point)
**Acute:** 45-90° (sharp point, moderate angle)
**Obtuse:** &gt;90° (blunt point, broad angle)
**Rounded:** No angle, completely curved
**Truncate:** Cut straight across (no point)

## Visual Identification

### The Angle Test

1. Look at leaf tip
2. Estimate angle where edges meet
3. More than 90° but still pointed → **Obtuse**
4. Completely rounded (no angle) → **Rounded**
5. Cut straight across → **Truncate**

**Remember:** 90° = right angle (like corner of square). Obtuse is wider/blunter than right angle.

## Costa Rican Examples

**Coco** (_Cocos nucifera_):

- Palm leaflets often obtuse-tipped
- Broad, blunt apex
- Beach palm

**Níspero** (_Manilkara zapota_):

- Leaves often obtuse to rounded
- Thick, leathery
- Sapodilla fruit tree

**Some Ficus species:**

- Variable apex forms
- Some have obtuse tips
- Depends on species and conditions

## Why Obtuse Tips?

### Functional Advantages

**Reduced mechanical stress:**

- Blunt tips less prone to tearing
- Wind damage reduction
- Important in exposed sites

**Water conservation:**

- Less surface area at tip
- Reduced transpiration
- Common in dry climates

**Protection:**

- Rounded tips less attractive to herbivores
- No vulnerable sharp point
- Damage-resistant

## Ecological Context

**Where obtuse is common:**

- Dry forest species
- Wind-exposed sites
- Beach/coastal trees
- Thick, leathery leaves

**Less common in:**

- Rainforest understory (prefer acuminate drip tips)
- Pioneer species (often acute)
- Temperate zones

## Common Mistakes

**Don't confuse:**

- Obtuse with rounded (obtuse still has slight point)
- Obtuse with acute (check angle - obtuse >90°)
- Obtuse with truncate (truncate is straight across)
- Damaged tip with natural obtuse form

**Remember:**

- Obtuse = blunt but still pointed
- Angle wider than 90° (right angle)
- Check multiple leaves on same tree
- Use protractor or folded paper for precision

## Field Recording

### Notation

**Precise:**

- "Apex obtuse" (>90° angle)
- "Apex obtuse to rounded" (variable, 90-180°)
- "Apex broadly obtuse" (very blunt, approaching rounded)

**Complete description:**
"Leaves simple, oblong, 8-12 cm long, margins entire, apex obtuse, base cuneate, glabrous on both surfaces, thick and leathery."

## Why It Matters

Understanding obtuse apexes helps with:

- **Tree identification**: Diagnostic feature
- **Species comparison**: Distinguishing similar species
- **Ecological adaptation**: Understanding environmental pressures
- **Botanical accuracy**: Precise terminology
- **Field guide use**: Standard descriptive language
