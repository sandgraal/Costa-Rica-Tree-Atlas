## What is a Hybrid?

A hybrid is the offspring of parents from two different species or distinct varieties. Hybrids often display "hybrid vigor" (heterosis) — growing faster, larger, or more vigorously than either parent — which makes them valuable in forestry and agriculture.

## Types of Hybrids

### Natural Hybrids

Occur spontaneously where the ranges of related species overlap:

- Designated with "×" in the name: _Quercus × hispanica_.
- Can occur between closely related tropical tree species.

### Artificial Hybrids

Created by controlled pollination:

- Common in plantation forestry and fruit-tree breeding.
- Selected for specific traits like growth rate, disease resistance, or wood quality.

## Hybrid Vigor (Heterosis)

Hybrids frequently outperform both parents:

- **Faster growth**: 20–50% faster than pure species in some plantation hybrids.
- **Disease resistance**: Hybrid combinations sometimes resist pathogens that attack either parent.
- **Stress tolerance**: Greater adaptability to challenging environments.

## Costa Rican Examples

### Eucalyptus Hybrids

_E. grandis_ × _E. urophylla_ (known as "urograndis") is widely planted in fast-rotation plantations for pulpwood and biomass.

### Teca Hybrids

Selected teak clones with hybrid backgrounds are planted in Guanacaste and the Pacific lowlands for accelerated timber production.

### Cacao Hybrids

Trinitario cacao — a natural hybrid between Criollo and Forastero — is the most commonly grown type in Caribbean Costa Rica.

## Considerations

- **Fertility**: Some hybrids are sterile or have reduced fertility.
- **Genetic pollution**: Hybrids can cross back with native species, diluting wild gene pools.
- **Conservation**: Distinguishing hybrids from pure species is important for conservation genetics.
