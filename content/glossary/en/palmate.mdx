## Visual Description

Palmate leaves have multiple leaflets that all originate from the same central point at the end of the leaf stalk (petiole), spreading outward like the fingers of a hand.

### Key Characteristics

- All leaflets connect at a single point
- Leaflets radiate outward in different directions
- Usually 3-7 leaflets per leaf
- Creates a distinctive hand-like or star-like pattern

### Variations

**Simple Palmate**

- Leaflets are not further divided
- Most common type

**Compound Palmate**

- Each leaflet may have its own subdivisions
- Less common in tropical species

## Identification Tips

When identifying palmate leaves:

- Count the number of leaflets (typically 3, 5, or 7)
- Check if all leaflets meet at one point
- Look for symmetrical arrangement
- Note leaflet size and shape variations

## Examples in Costa Rica

Several Costa Rican trees display palmate leaves:

- **Ceiba** (_Ceiba pentandra_): Palmate with 5-7 leaflets
- **Pochote** (_Pachira quinata_): Five leaflets in palmate arrangement
- **Bucaro** (_Erythrina poeppigiana_): Trifoliate palmate (3 leaflets)
