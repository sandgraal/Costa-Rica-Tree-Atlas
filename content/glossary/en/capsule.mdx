## What is a Capsule?

A capsule is a dry fruit that splits open when mature, releasing many seeds. Unlike fleshy fruits, capsules depend on wind, gravity, or explosive mechanisms for seed dispersal rather than animals eating them.

## Structure and Opening

### Key Characteristics

- **Dry**: Hard, papery, or woody (not fleshy)
- **Dehiscent**: Splits open at maturity
- **Multi-seeded**: Contains multiple seeds
- **Multi-carpellate**: Formed from 2+ carpels

### Opening Methods

**Loculicidal**: Splits down the middle of each carpel
**Septicidal**: Splits between carpels at seams
**Poricidal**: Opens through pores (rare)
**Explosive**: Forcibly ejects seeds

## Costa Rican Capsule Trees

### Ceiba (_Ceiba pentandra_)

- Large woody capsules 15-20cm long
- Split into 5 sections
- Release silky-haired seeds
- Float on wind like cotton

### Pochote (_Pachira quinata_)

- Oval woody capsules
- Explosive dehiscence
- Seeds embedded in white fiber
- Similar to ceiba but smaller

### Jacaranda (_Jacaranda mimosifolia_)

- Flat, round capsules
- Woody texture
- Contain many winged seeds
- Common ornamental street tree

## Capsule vs. Other Dry Fruits

| Fruit Type | Opening     | Seeds | Example        |
| ---------- | ----------- | ----- | -------------- |
| Capsule    | Splits open | Many  | Ceiba, Pochote |
| Follicle   | One side    | Many  | Magnolia       |
| Legume     | Two sides   | Many  | Beans          |
| Achene     | Stays shut  | One   | Sunflower      |
| Samara     | Stays shut  | One   | Maple (winged) |

## Dispersal Strategies

### Wind Dispersal

- Seeds with silky hairs (Ceiba)
- Winged seeds (Jacaranda)
- Light, numerous seeds

### Gravity Dispersal

- Heavy capsules fall and break
- Seeds scatter locally
- Accumulate near parent

### Explosive Dispersal

- Capsule builds tension
- Bursts open suddenly
- Flings seeds meters away

## Why It Matters

Understanding capsules helps with:

- **Identification**: Capsule shape and size are diagnostic
- **Seed collection**: Timing harvest before dispersal
- **Propagation**: Knowing when seeds are mature
- **Ecology**: Understanding dispersal strategies

## Field Recognition

**Quick ID Tips:**

1. Look for dry, hard fruit
2. Check for split lines or seams
3. Count seed compartments
4. Note if seeds have wings or hairs
5. Observe on ground (already opened)

**Best Observation Time:**

- Late dry season for many species
- Watch for capsules starting to split
- Collect before complete dehiscence
