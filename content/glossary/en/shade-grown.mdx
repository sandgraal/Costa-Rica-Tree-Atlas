## What is Shade-Grown?

Shade-grown refers to crops cultivated under a canopy of trees rather than in full sun. This traditional practice is most associated with coffee and cacao in Costa Rica, where shade trees provide a host of ecological and quality benefits.

## How It Works

### Canopy Management

- **Shade level**: Typically 35–65% shade cover, adjusted by pruning.
- **Tree species**: Leguminous trees (Guaba, Poró) preferred for nitrogen fixation.
- **Canopy structure**: Multi-layered — tall emergent trees over intermediate shade trees over the crop.

## Benefits

### For the Crop

- **Quality**: Slower maturation concentrates flavor compounds — shade-grown coffee is prize-winning.
- **Reduced stress**: Lower temperatures and humidity fluctuations.
- **Natural pest control**: Shade attracts insect-eating birds that reduce pest populations.

### For the Environment

- **Biodiversity**: Shade-coffee farms support up to 150 bird species — close to natural forest levels.
- **Carbon storage**: Trees sequester significant carbon above and below ground.
- **Soil health**: Leaf litter maintains organic matter; roots prevent erosion.
- **Water**: Tree canopies reduce runoff and improve water quality.

## Costa Rican Context

### Coffee Under Shade

Costa Rica pioneered the certification of shade-grown coffee. The Tarrazú, Central Valley, and West Valley regions are renowned for shade-grown specialty coffee.

### Cacao Under Shade

Caribbean lowland cacao is traditionally grown under Guaba, Laurel, and Poró shade — a system dating back to pre-Columbian times.

## Shade-Grown vs. Sun-Grown

| Feature           | Shade-Grown           | Sun-Grown          |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| Yield per hectare | Lower                 | Higher             |
| Quality           | Superior flavor       | Standard           |
| Biodiversity      | High (forest-like)    | Very low           |
| Inputs            | Low (natural cycling) | High (fertilizers) |
