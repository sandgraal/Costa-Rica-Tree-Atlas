technicalDefinition: "A leaf shape that is broadest above the middle and tapers toward the base, resembling an inverted ovate (egg) shape. The apex is broader and more rounded than the base. Distinguished from ovate (widest below middle) and elliptic (widest at middle) by the position of maximum width in the upper half of the blade."

## What is Obovate?

An obovate leaf is egg-shaped but upside down—widest above the middle, tapering gradually toward the base. Hold an egg fat-end up, and you have the obovate shape.

## Identifying Obovate Leaves

### Key Features

1. **Widest above middle**: Maximum width in upper half
2. **Tapers to base**: Narrows gradually toward petiole
3. **Broader apex**: Tip region wider than base region
4. **Inverted egg**: Egg shape flipped upside down
5. **Asymmetric taper**: Base tapers more than apex

## Quick Visual Test

**The balance test:**

1. Find the widest point
2. Above the middle? → **Obovate**
3. Below the middle? → **Ovate**
4. At the middle? → **Elliptic** or **Oval**

## Costa Rican Examples

**Marañón** (_Anacardium occidentale_):

- Classic obovate leaves
- Widest well above middle
- 8-22 cm long
- Cashew tree

**Almendro de playa** (_Terminalia catappa_):

- Large obovate leaves
- 15-25 cm long
- Turns red before falling
- Beach almond

**Some Cedro species** (_Cedrela_ spp.):

- Leaflets often obovate
- Compound leaves
- Important timber trees

## Why Obovate?

**Functional advantages:**

- Shades petiole attachment
- Protects bud in leaf axil
- Strong structural support
- Good water distribution

## Similar Shapes Comparison

**Obovate:** Widest above middle (inverted egg)
**Ovate:** Widest below middle (egg shape)
**Elliptic:** Widest at middle (football shape)
**Spatulate:** Spoon-shaped (extreme obovate)

## Why It Matters

Understanding obovate helps with:

- Species identification
- Recognizing similar trees
- Accurate botanical descriptions
- Field guide comprehension
