## What is Cauliflory?

Cauliflory is the striking phenomenon where flowers — and subsequently fruits — emerge directly from the trunk and major branches of a tree rather than from the tips of young shoots. This unusual growth habit is uncommon in temperate trees but relatively frequent in tropical species.

## Why Does It Happen?

### Ecological Advantages

1. **Bat pollination**: Large flowers on the trunk are more accessible to hovering bats.
2. **Large fruit support**: Heavy fruits (like cacao pods) need the structural support of thick branches or the trunk.
3. **Understory access**: Trunk-level flowers are visible to ground-dwelling and mid-level pollinators.
4. **Mammal dispersal**: Trunk-level fruits are accessible to ground-dwelling seed dispersers.

## Costa Rican Examples

### Cacao (_Theobroma cacao_)

The most famous cauliflorous tree — tiny flowers emerge in clusters directly from the bark, pollinated by midges, producing the large pods harvested for chocolate.

### Ira Rosa (_Brownea macrophylla_)

Spectacular red flower clusters burst from the trunk and old branches, attracting hummingbirds.

### Guapinol (_Hymenaea courbaril_)

Flowers appear on older branches and the upper trunk — bats are key pollinators.

## Related Phenomena

- **Ramiflory**: Flowers on smaller branches (intermediate between cauliflory and typical flowering).
- **Flagelliflory**: Flowers on long, hanging stalks from the trunk.

## Why It Matters

- **Pollination ecology**: Cauliflory reveals specialized pollinator relationships (especially bats and flies).
- **Agriculture**: Understanding cauliflory is essential for managing cacao production.
- **Identification**: Cauliflorous species are easily identified by their trunk-borne flowers or fruits.
