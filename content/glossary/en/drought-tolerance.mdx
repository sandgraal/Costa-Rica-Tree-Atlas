term: "Drought Tolerance"
locale: "en"
slug: "drought-tolerance"
simpleDefinition: "The ability of a plant to survive and grow during periods of water scarcity or limited rainfall."
technicalDefinition: "The capacity of a plant to maintain physiological functions, growth, and survival under water deficit conditions. Achieved through morphological adaptations (deep roots, small leaves, thick cuticles), physiological mechanisms (stomatal control, osmotic adjustment, ABA signaling), and phenological strategies (deciduousness during dry season). Critical for survival in Costa Rica's dry forests and during verano (dry season)."
category: "ecology"
pronunciation: "drowt TAWL-er-unss"
etymology: "From Middle English 'droght' (dryness) + Latin 'tolerantia' (endurance). Refers to plant's endurance of dry conditions."

## What is Drought Tolerance?

Drought tolerance is a plant's ability to survive dry periods—the months-long dry season (verano) in Guanacaste, temporary droughts, or naturally arid habitats. Costa Rica's dry forests are full of drought-tolerant species.

## Drought Tolerance Strategies

### 1. Drought Avoidance

- Drop leaves (deciduous)
- Deep taproots reach water
- Store water in trunk
- Example: Guanacaste, Corteza Amarilla

### 2. Drought Endurance

- Thick waxy cuticle
- Small leaves (less water loss)
- Efficient water use
- Example: Indio Desnudo

### 3. Drought Escape

- Complete lifecycle before drought
- Rapid growth in wet season
- Annual/ephemeral strategy
- Example: Some dry forest herbs

## Costa Rican Drought-Tolerant Trees

**Guanacaste** (_Enterolobium cyclocarpum_):

- Deciduous in dry season
- Deep taproot
- Icon of dry forest
- National tree

**Indio Desnudo** (_Bursera simaruba_):

- Peeling red bark
- Stores water
- Evergreen or briefly deciduous
- Guanacaste symbol

**Corteza Amarilla** (_Handroanthus ochraceus_):

- Yellow flowering when leafless
- Spectacular dry season blooms
- Deep roots
- Drought-adapted timber tree

## Why It Matters

Understanding drought tolerance helps with:

- Tree selection for dry regions
- Water-wise landscaping
- Climate adaptation
- Dry forest conservation
- Predicting climate change impacts
