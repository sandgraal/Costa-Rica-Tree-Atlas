## Visual Description

**Petals** are the colorful, often fragrant parts of a flower that most people think of when they imagine "the flower." They form the inner ring of the flower, surrounding the reproductive organs (stamens and pistils).

### Key Features

- **Colorful**: Usually bright colors (yellow, pink, red, white, purple)
- **Delicate texture**: Softer than leaves, often velvety or papery
- **Arranged in a ring**: Form the corolla (collective term for all petals)
- **Variable number**: Can range from 3-4 to dozens or even hundreds
- **Often scented**: Many produce fragrances to attract pollinators

### Why Petals Exist

Petals evolved with one primary purpose: **attract pollinators**.

**Functions:**

- **Visual signals**: Bright colors guide pollinators from a distance
- **Landing platforms**: Provide a place for insects and birds to land
- **Nectar guides**: Often have lines or patterns (visible in UV) directing pollinators to nectar
- **Protection**: Shield reproductive organs from rain and damage
- **Rewards**: Some petals themselves contain oils or scents pollinators harvest

## How to Identify

### Petal vs. Sepal

Many people confuse petals with sepals:

- **Petals**: Colorful, inner ring, attract pollinators
- **Sepals**: Usually green, outer ring, protect bud

**Trick:** Sepals are what you see BEFORE the flower opens. Petals are what opens UP from inside.

### Petal Count Matters

Petal number can help identify plant families:

- **3 or 6 petals**: Often monocots (palms, lilies)
- **4 petals**: Crucifers (mustard family)
- **5 petals**: Very common in many families (roses, legumes)
- **Many petals**: Magnolias, water lilies

### Petal Fusion

**Free petals** (polypetalous):

- Each petal separate
- Example: Rose, Buttercup

**Fused petals** (sympetalous):

- Petals joined into tube or trumpet
- Example: Morning glory, Trumpet tree

## Identification Tip

When identifying trees by flowers, note:

1. **Number of petals**: Count carefully (may need magnifier)
2. **Color and pattern**: Document color accurately
3. **Shape**: Rounded, pointed, notched?
4. **Size**: Measure largest petal
5. **Fusion**: Are petals separate or joined?
6. **Persistence**: Do they fall quickly or stay on tree?

## Examples in Costa Rica

**Spectacular Petal Displays:**

**Yellow Petals:**

- **Corteza Amarilla** (_Handroanthus ochraceus_): 5 large yellow petals, trumpet-shaped
- **Guayacán Real** (_Guaiacum sanctum_): 5 blue-purple petals (rare color!)

**Pink/Purple Petals:**

- **Roble de Sabana** (_Tabebuia rosea_): 5 pink petals, showy spring display
- **Jacaranda**: Tubular purple flowers with 5 petal lobes

**White Petals:**

- **Madero Negro** (_Gliricidia sepium_): Pink-purple pea-like flowers
- **Jiñocuave**: Small white fragrant flowers

**No True Petals:**

- **Figs** (_Ficus_ spp.): Flowers hidden inside fruit
- **Many wind-pollinated trees**: Reduced or absent petals

## Ecological Importance

### Pollinator Partnerships

Different petal characteristics attract different pollinators:

**Hummingbirds:**

- Red, orange, or pink petals
- Tubular shape
- No scent needed
- Example: Many _Erythrina_ species

**Bees:**

- Blue, purple, yellow, white
- Landing platform shape
- Often scented
- UV patterns (invisible to humans)

**Moths:**

- White or pale colors
- Strong nighttime fragrance
- Open at dusk
- Example: Night-blooming jasmine

**Bats:**

- Large, sturdy petals
- White or pale colors
- Strong fermented/musky scent
- Open at night

### Seasonal Displays

In Costa Rica's tropical dry forest, many trees produce flowers during the **dry season** (December-April) when leaves have fallen:

- **Why?** Better visibility for pollinators
- **Result:** Spectacular color displays on bare branches
- **Examples:** _Tabebuia_ species create massive yellow and pink clouds

## Petal Modifications

Not all petals are simple flat structures:

**Spurs:**

- Long tubular extensions
- Store nectar at base
- Example: Orchids, Columbine

**Pouches:**

- Trap pollinators temporarily
- Ensure pollen transfer
- Example: Lady's slipper orchids

**Mimicry:**

- Some petals mimic other structures
- Example: Orchids that look like female bees or wasps

## Cultural Significance

### Traditional Uses

**Medicinal:**

- Flower petals often used in herbal remedies
- May contain beneficial compounds
- Example: Hibiscus petals for tea

**Ceremonial:**

- Flower petals used in festivals and celebrations
- Religious offerings
- Wedding decorations

**Culinary:**

- Some tree flower petals are edible
- Used in salads, teas, garnishes
- Example: Squash blossoms (though not from trees)

## Conservation Note

**Petal color changes** can indicate environmental stress:

- Pollution may alter petal colors
- Climate change affects flowering timing
- Loss of pollinators means petals evolve differently

## Related Concepts

- **Corolla**: The collective term for all petals of a flower
- **Perianth**: Combined term for petals + sepals
- **Tepals**: When petals and sepals look identical (like magnolias)
- **Nectary**: Special structures (often on petals) that produce nectar
- **Pollination syndrome**: The set of flower traits (including petal shape/color) that attract specific pollinators
