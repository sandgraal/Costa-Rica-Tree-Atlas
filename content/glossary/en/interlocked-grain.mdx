## What is Interlocked Grain?

Interlocked grain occurs when the wood fibers in a tree grow in one direction for several years, then reverse to grow in the opposite direction. This alternating spiral produces a grain pattern that is mechanically "locked" together, making the wood very difficult to split.

## How It Forms

1. The cambium periodically reverses the helical angle of new fiber cells.
2. Adjacent growth layers have fibers oriented in opposite directions.
3. The resulting interlock mechanically binds the layers together.

## Visual Effects

- **Ribbon stripe**: Quarter-sawn boards show alternating light/dark stripes as fibers reflect light differently.
- **Roey figure**: A shimmering, wavy appearance caused by the changing fiber direction.
- **Difficult planing**: Grain reversal causes tear-out when planing in one direction.

## Costa Rican Examples

### Guapinol (_Hymenaea courbaril_)

Strongly interlocked grain makes this dense wood nearly impossible to split — ideal for heavy construction.

### Espavel (_Anacardium excelsum_)

Moderate interlocked grain creates attractive ribbon figure in flat-sawn boards.

## Practical Significance

- **Split resistance**: Ideal for tool handles, structural beams, and decking.
- **Machining challenge**: Requires sharp tools and reduced cutting angles.
- **Drying difficulty**: Interlocked grain increases warping tendency during kiln-drying.
