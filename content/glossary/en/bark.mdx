term: "Bark"
locale: "en"
slug: "bark"
simpleDefinition: "The protective outer covering of a tree's trunk, branches, and roots."
technicalDefinition: "The tissues external to the vascular cambium, including both the inner bark (phloem, which transports nutrients) and outer bark (dead protective tissues). Bark protects the tree from physical damage, insects, disease, fire, and water loss."
category: "morphology"
pronunciation: "BARK"
etymology: "From Old Norse 'börkr' meaning bark or rind, related to breaking or peeling."

## Concept Explanation

**Bark** is a tree's armor—the protective outer layer that shields living tissues from the outside world. It's not just dead material; it includes both living transport tissue (inner bark) and protective dead layers (outer bark).

### Structure

**Inner Bark (Phloem):**

- Living tissue
- Transports sugars from leaves to roots
- Active growth layer
- Usually thin

**Outer Bark:**

- Dead protective tissue
- Insulation and protection
- Constantly renewed from inside
- Variable thickness (mm to 30+ cm)

**Cambium (beneath bark):**

- Growth layer
- Produces new bark outward
- Produces new wood inward

## Bark Types and Patterns

**Smooth:**

- Thin, tight bark
- Common on young trees
- Example: Guayabo, young Ceiba
- May have lenticels (breathing pores)

**Furrowed:**

- Deep grooves and ridges
- Thick, corky bark
- Fire-resistant
- Example: Oaks, old conifers

**Scaly/Flaky:**

- Peels in small scales or flakes
- Constantly renewing
- Example: Eucalyptus, Sycamore

**Plated:**

- Large, flat plates
- Example: Pines

**Papery:**

- Thin, peeling in sheets
- Example: Birch, Gumbo Limbo

**Spiny:**

- Thorns or spines on bark
- Defense mechanism
- Example: Pochote, Javillo

**Smooth Green:**

- Photosynthetic bark
- Young branches
- Example: Palo Verde

## Functions of Bark

**Protection:**

- Physical armor against injury
- Insulation from temperature extremes
- Fire resistance (thick bark)
- Waterproofing
- Defense against insects/disease

**Transport:**

- Phloem moves sugars/nutrients
- Essential for tree survival
- "Girdling" (removing bark ring) kills tree

**Storage:**

- Some bark stores nutrients
- Cork tissue in outer layers
- Reserve materials

**Gas Exchange:**

- Lenticels allow oxygen in
- Necessary for living tissues
- Visible as small pores or bumps

## Bark Identification

Bark is a KEY identification feature:

**Young vs. Old:**

- Bark changes dramatically with age
- Young: Often smooth
- Old: Develops characteristic pattern
- Check bark on trunk, not twigs

**Color Variations:**

- White: Birch
- Red/Cinnamon: Gumbo Limbo, some Cedars
- Green: Palo Verde (photosynthetic)
- Gray/Brown: Most temperate trees
- Black: Some Oaks

**Texture:**

- Smooth vs. rough
- Furrowed depth
- Plate size
- Peeling pattern

## Costa Rican Bark Examples

**Distinctive Barks:**

- **Pochote** (_Pachira quinata_): Green, spiny when young
- **Guayabo** (_Psidium guajava_): Smooth, peeling copper-brown
- **Guarumo** (_Cecropia_): Smooth, pale gray with rings
- **Gumbo Limbo** (_Bursera simaruba_): Red, peeling "tourist tree"
- **Ceiba** (_Ceiba pentandra_): Spiny when young, smooth gray when mature

## Bark Uses

**Commercial:**

- **Cork**: Cork oak bark
- **Cinnamon**: Inner bark of _Cinnamomum_
- **Quinine**: Bark of Cinchona
- **Tannins**: Oak bark for leather tanning
- **Dyes**: Various colors from different barks
- **Medicine**: Willow bark (aspirin source)

**Traditional:**

- Medicine (antipyretics, astringents)
- Fiber for rope, cloth
- Tannins for tanning hides
- Dyes and pigments

**Ecological:**

- Wildlife habitat (insects, lichens, mosses)
- Food for some animals
- Nesting material

## Bark Damage

**Natural:**

- Lightning strikes
- Wind/ice damage
- Animal feeding (deer, porcupines)
- Woodpecker excavation
- Elephant rubbing (Africa)

**Human-caused:**

- Carving/vandalism
- Construction damage
- Lawnmower/trimmer wounds
- Improper pruning

**Consequences:**

- Entry point for disease
- Insect infestation
- Structural weakness
- Death if girdled completely

## Bark and Fire Adaptation

**Thick Bark = Fire Survival:**

- Longleaf pine: 5 cm+ bark
- Giant Sequoia: up to 60 cm!
- Cork oak: thick, insulating
- Allows tree to survive ground fires

**Costa Rica Context:**

- Dry forest trees may have thicker bark
- Fire is less common in rainforest
- Some species sprout from roots after fire

## Seasonal Changes

**In Temperate Climates:**

- Bark expands/contracts with temperature
- Can split in winter (frost cracks)
- Some trees shed bark in summer

**In Tropical Climates:**

- Less seasonal variation
- Growth flushes create bark patterns
- Wet/dry seasons affect appearance

## Conservation Note

**Bark Harvesting:**

- Sustainable: Cork (regrows)
- Destructive: Cinnamon (kills tree if ring-barked)
- Overharvested: Some medicinal barks
- Need careful management

## Fun Facts

- Cork oak bark can be harvested ~9 times in tree's life
- Redwood bark is fireproof and can be 30 cm thick
- Some bark contains latex (rubber tree)
- Aspirin was first derived from willow bark
- Girdling a tree kills it by blocking phloem
