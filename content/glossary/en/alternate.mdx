## Visual Description

In **alternate leaf arrangement**, leaves are attached **one at a time** along the stem, at different heights. Each leaf emerges from a different point (node) on the stem, creating a staggered or spiral pattern.

### Key Features

- **One leaf per node**: Only a single leaf attachment point
- **Spiral pattern**: Leaves wrap around the stem in a helix
- **Varied angles**: Leaves positioned at different angles around stem
- **No pairing**: Leaves don't appear in matched pairs

### Why This Pattern?

Alternate arrangement offers advantages:

**Light Capture:**

- Minimizes self-shading
- Each leaf can capture sunlight without blocking others
- More efficient in dense forests

**Structural:**

- Better weight distribution
- Reduces stress on stem
- Allows for flexible branching

## How to Identify

Look at the stem and count:

- If you see ONE leaf at each level → **Alternate**
- If you see TWO leaves at each level → **Opposite**
- If you see THREE or more at each level → **Whorled**

### Common Patterns

**Spiral Alternate:**

- Most common type
- Leaves wrap around stem in spiral
- Example: Oak, Apple, Willow

**Distichous Alternate:**

- Leaves in two rows
- Flat, plane-like arrangement
- Example: Some grasses, Elms

## Identification Tip

When identifying trees, leaf arrangement is one of the first things to check:

1. Look at several nodes to confirm pattern
2. Check young growth for clearest examples
3. Note that some trees switch patterns with age

## Examples in Costa Rica

**Trees with Alternate Leaves:**

- **Guayabo** (_Psidium guajava_): Simple, alternate
- **Mango** (_Mangifera indica_): Simple, alternate
- **Aguacate** (_Persea americana_): Simple, alternate
- **Laurel** (_Cordia alliodora_): Simple, alternate
- **Most fruit trees**: Alternate arrangement

### Statistical Note

Approximately **80% of plant species** have alternate leaf arrangement, making it the most common pattern in nature.

## Related Concepts

- **Phyllotaxis**: The study of leaf arrangement patterns
- **Fibonacci spiral**: Many alternate leaves follow mathematical spiral patterns
- **Leaf divergence angle**: The angle between successive leaves (often 137.5°)
