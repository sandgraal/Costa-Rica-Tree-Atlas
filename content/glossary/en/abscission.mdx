## What is Abscission?

Abscission is the carefully controlled process a tree uses to drop its leaves, flowers, or fruit. The tree creates a separation layer (abscission zone) at the base of the organ, which weakens until the organ falls away cleanly, leaving a sealed scar.

## The Process

### Step by Step

1. **Hormonal signal**: Decrease in auxin and increase in ethylene trigger abscission.
2. **Zone formation**: Cells at the base of the petiole differentiate into an abscission zone.
3. **Cell wall dissolution**: Enzymes break down the cell walls in the zone.
4. **Separation**: The organ detaches — often aided by wind, rain, or gravity.
5. **Scar sealing**: A protective layer (wound periderm) forms over the scar.

## Types of Abscission

### Leaf Abscission

- **Seasonal**: Deciduous trees drop all leaves during the dry season (Guanacaste, Pochote).
- **Continuous**: Evergreen trees drop and replace leaves year-round.
- **Stress-induced**: Drought, disease, or herbivory can trigger premature leaf drop.

### Flower Abscission

- Unfertilized flowers drop after the pollination window closes.

### Fruit Abscission

- Mature fruit drops when ripe (gravity dispersal).
- Immature fruit may be abscised to redirect resources (fruit thinning).

## Costa Rican Examples

### Dry-Season Leaf Drop

In Guanacaste, dry-forest species like Pochote and Guanacaste undergo dramatic leaf abscission in January–March, creating a stark, bare-branched landscape.

### Corteza Amarilla

Drops leaves just before flowering, allowing the spectacular yellow blooms to be fully visible on bare branches.

## Why It Matters

- **Water conservation**: Leaf abscission reduces water loss during the dry season.
- **Nutrient recovery**: Before abscission, trees withdraw valuable nutrients from leaves.
- **Fruit harvesting**: Understanding abscission helps determine optimal harvest timing.
- **Forestry**: Abnormal abscission patterns can indicate tree disease or environmental stress.
