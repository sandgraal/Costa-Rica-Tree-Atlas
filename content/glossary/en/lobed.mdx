simpleDefinition: "A leaf with deep indentations that create distinct rounded or pointed sections, like fingers or parts of a jigsaw puzzle, but where the divisions don't reach all the way to the midrib."
technicalDefinition: "A leaf margin with incisions (sinuses) extending 25-50% of the distance from the margin to the midrib, creating distinct projections (lobes) separated by indentations. Distinguished from dissected (divisions deeper than 50%) and toothed (shallow indentations less than 25%)."

## What is a Lobed Leaf?

A lobed leaf has deep indentations that create distinct sections or "fingers" without dividing the leaf completely. The cuts go partway toward the center vein but stop before reaching it, creating a characteristic shape.

## Identifying Lobed Leaves

### Key Features

1. **Deep indentations**: Cuts go 25-50% toward midrib
2. **Distinct sections**: Creates separate "lobes" or projections
3. **Connected base**: All lobes attached to same central vein
4. **Rounded or pointed**: Lobes can have various shapes
5. **Symmetrical or asymmetrical**: Pattern may be regular or irregular

## Types of Lobed Leaves

### By Lobe Arrangement

**Palmately Lobed**:

- Lobes radiate from central point like fingers on hand
- Example: Fig leaves (_Ficus_ species)
- All lobes emerge from same attachment point
- 3-11 lobes typical

**Pinnately Lobed**:

- Lobes arranged along central midrib
- Example: Oak leaves in temperate zones
- Feather-like appearance
- Lobes alternate or opposite along midrib

### By Lobe Depth

**Shallowly Lobed (25-33% depth)**:

- Gentle undulations
- Barely qualifies as "lobed"
- Transition between toothed and lobed

**Moderately Lobed (33-45% depth)**:

- Clear lobe definition
- Most common lobed pattern
- Balance between division and unity

**Deeply Lobed (45-50% depth)**:

- Almost divided
- Approaches "dissected" category
- Very pronounced lobes

### By Lobe Shape

**Rounded lobes**: Smooth, circular projections
**Pointed lobes**: Sharp, angular extensions
**Irregular lobes**: Variable shape and size
**Toothed lobes**: Lobes with serrated edges (double-toothed)

## Depth Classification

### Measuring Lobe Depth

**How to measure:**

1. Find deepest indentation (sinus)
2. Measure from leaf margin to bottom of sinus
3. Measure from margin to midrib at widest point
4. Calculate percentage: (sinus depth / margin-to-midrib distance) × 100

**Classification:**

- **Toothed/Serrated**: <25% depth
- **Lobed**: 25-50% depth
- **Cleft**: 50-75% depth
- **Divided/Dissected**: >75% depth, almost to midrib
- **Compound**: Completely separate leaflets

## Costa Rican Trees with Lobed Leaves

### Common Examples

**Papaya** (_Carica papaya_):

- Deeply palmately lobed (7-9 lobes)
- Lobes extend ~40% to center
- Very large leaves (50-70 cm wide)
- Each lobe is pinnately lobed again (double-lobed)

**Various Ficus Species**:

- _Ficus insipida_: Slightly lobed when juvenile
- _Ficus citrifolia_: Sometimes 3-lobed at base
- Highly variable within species
- Mature leaves often lose lobing

**Roble Encino** (_Quercus oleoides_):

- Pinnately lobed like temperate oaks
- 3-5 pairs of rounded lobes
- Typical oak leaf shape
- Some leaves more deeply lobed than others

**Cecropia** (_Cecropia_ species):

- Deeply palmately lobed (7-11 lobes)
- Lobes extend 40-45% to center
- Silver-white undersides
- Very distinctive shape

### Why Lobing Occurs

**Evolutionary advantages:**

- **Wind resistance**: Lobes allow wind to pass through, reducing damage
- **Light penetration**: Allows light to reach lower leaves
- **Heat dissipation**: Increases edge-to-area ratio for cooling
- **Herbivore deterrence**: Some theories suggest harder to eat
- **Water runoff**: Lobes may channel water to specific points

## Ecological Patterns

### Climate Correlation

**More common in:**

- Temperate zones (oak forests)
- Seasonal tropical areas
- Variable moisture environments

**Less common in:**

- Stable tropical rainforests
- Arid deserts
- Extreme climates

### Ontogenetic Changes

**Juvenile leaves**:

- Often more deeply lobed
- Higher lobe number
- More irregular patterns

**Mature leaves**:

- Lobes may become shallower
- More consistent shape
- Sometimes lose lobing entirely

**Sun vs. shade leaves**:

- Sun leaves: Often less lobed, thicker
- Shade leaves: May be more deeply lobed

## Functional Significance

### Hydraulic Conductance

**Lobed leaves have:**

- More edge relative to area
- Easier water transport to leaf margins
- Faster transpiration rates
- Better suited for high water availability

### Temperature Regulation

**Advantages:**

- High edge-to-area ratio dissipates heat
- Lobes act as "cooling fingers"
- Better in hot, sunny conditions
- Reduces leaf temperature 2-5°C

## Common Confusion

### Lobed vs. Compound

**Lobed leaf:**

- All sections attached to one central vein
- Single continuous blade
- No articulation points

**Compound leaf:**

- Completely separate leaflets
- Each leaflet on its own petiolule
- Can drop leaflets independently

### Lobed vs. Toothed

**Lobed:**

- Deep indentations (25-50%)
- Creates distinct projections
- Rounded or broadly pointed

**Toothed/Serrated:**

- Shallow indentations (<25%)
- Small sharp projections
- Fine texture on margin

## Field Identification Tips

### How to Confirm Lobing

1. **Check depth**: Must extend 25-50% toward midrib
2. **Count lobes**: Usually 3-11 lobes
3. **Examine attachment**: All lobes continuous with blade
4. **Look for pattern**: Palmate or pinnate arrangement
5. **Compare leaves**: Variation within plant is normal

### Why It Matters

Understanding lobed leaves helps with:

- **Tree identification**: Distinctive shape narrows options
- **Growth stage**: Juvenile vs mature foliage
- **Environmental conditions**: Indicates moisture, sun exposure
- **Taxonomic relationships**: Related species often share lobe patterns
- **Botanical illustration**: Key feature to render accurately
