## What is Wood Grain?

Wood grain is the pattern you see when wood is cut, created by the alignment of wood fibers as the tree grows. It determines how wood looks, how strong it is, and how easy it is to work with tools.

## Types of Grain

### Grain Direction

**Straight grain**: Fibers run parallel to trunk

- Strongest wood
- Easiest to work
- Most common pattern
- Examples: Teak, Pine

**Interlocked grain**: Fibers spiral alternately

- Creates ribbon figure
- Harder to split
- Tear-out when planing
- Examples: Sapele, some mahoganies

**Wavy grain**: Fibers undulate

- Creates fiddleback figure
- Beautiful appearance
- Challenging to plane
- Examples: Maple, some cocobolo

**Irregular grain**: No consistent pattern

- Around knots and burls
- Very decorative
- Difficult to work
- Examples: Burl wood

### Grain Texture

**Coarse grain**: Large, open pores

- Oak, ash, mahogany
- Needs grain filler for smooth finish

**Fine grain**: Small, tight pores

- Maple, cherry, boxwood
- Takes smooth finish naturally

## Reading Grain Direction

### Planing Direction

When planing, work **with the grain**:

- Fibers angle toward surface ahead
- Smooth, clean cuts
- No tear-out

Against the grain causes:

- Rough surface
- Torn fibers
- Splintering

### Growth Rings

- **Wide rings**: Fast growth, softer wood
- **Narrow rings**: Slow growth, harder wood
- **Even rings**: Consistent growing conditions
- **Irregular rings**: Stress, drought, damage

## Costa Rican Hardwoods

### Teca/Teak (_Tectona grandis_)

- **Grain**: Straight, sometimes interlocked
- **Texture**: Medium-coarse
- **Figure**: Subtle stripes
- **Workability**: Excellent
- **Uses**: Outdoor furniture, boats

### Cocobolo (_Dalbergia retusa_)

- **Grain**: Interlocked, often irregular
- **Texture**: Fine
- **Figure**: Dramatic color streaks
- **Workability**: Challenging (blunts tools)
- **Uses**: Fine woodworking, instruments

### Cedro (_Cedrela odorata_)

- **Grain**: Straight to interlocked
- **Texture**: Medium
- **Figure**: Cedar-like appearance
- **Workability**: Good
- **Uses**: Furniture, boat building

## Grain and Strength

### Mechanical Properties

**With the grain** (longitudinal):

- 10-100x stronger than across grain
- Resists compression, tension
- Ideal for structural loads

**Across the grain** (transverse):

- Weaker, splits easily
- Vulnerable to cleavage
- Avoid perpendicular loads

**Quarter-sawn** (radial):

- Grain perpendicular to face
- Most stable
- Least warping
- Highest value

**Flat-sawn** (tangential):

- Grain parallel to face
- Shows cathedral patterns
- More warping
- Most common

## Visual Effects

### Figure vs. Grain

**Grain**: Fiber direction
**Figure**: Visual patterns from:

- Growth rings (cathedral, flame)
- Ray cells (flakes in oak)
- Color variation (ribbon, stripe)
- Irregular growth (burl, crotch)

## Working with Grain

### Woodworking Tips

1. **Identify grain direction** before cutting
2. **Plane with the grain** for smooth results
3. **Pre-drill across grain** to prevent splitting
4. **Seal end grain** to prevent moisture loss
5. **Account for wood movement** perpendicular to grain

## Why It Matters

Understanding grain helps with:

- **Wood identification**: Species have characteristic grain
- **Quality assessment**: Straight grain indicates quality
- **Safety**: Working with grain prevents kickback
- **Finishing**: Grain direction affects stain absorption
- **Structural design**: Orient grain for maximum strength

## Field Identification

**Look for grain patterns:**

- On freshly cut stumps
- In exposed wood surfaces
- Through bark cracks
- In fallen branches

**Grain tells you:**

- Tree growth rate
- Growing conditions
- Age (count rings)
- Stress history
