## What is Endosperm?

Endosperm is the food warehouse inside a seed. It stores the starch, oils, and proteins that fuel the embryo's growth during germination and early seedling development. In some species the endosperm persists in the mature seed; in others, it is absorbed by the embryo before the seed is shed.

## Formation

Unique to flowering plants (angiosperms):

1. **Double fertilization**: One sperm fuses with the egg (forming embryo); a second sperm fuses with two polar nuclei (forming triploid endosperm).
2. **Cell division**: Endosperm cells rapidly divide and fill with stored nutrients.
3. **Maturation**: In some species, the embryo absorbs the endosperm before the seed matures.

## Types

### Persistent Endosperm (Albuminous Seeds)

Endosperm remains in the mature seed:

- **Coconut**: Liquid endosperm (coconut water) + solid endosperm (coconut meat).
- **Coffee**: Endosperm is what we roast and brew.
- **Palms**: Many palm seeds have hard, oily endosperm.

### Absorbed Endosperm (Exalbuminous Seeds)

Embryo absorbs the endosperm before maturity:

- **Beans and legumes**: Cotyledons contain all the stored food.
- **Mango**: Large cotyledons provide all germination energy.

## Costa Rican Examples

### Coco (_Cocos nucifera_)

The largest and most familiar endosperm — coconut water and meat are endosperm tissue.

### Coffee (_Coffea arabica_)

The endosperm of the coffee seed is what is dried, roasted, and brewed — the "bean."

### Pejibaye (_Bactris gasipaes_)

Oily, starchy endosperm made this palm the staple food crop of pre-Columbian peoples.

## Why It Matters

- **Agriculture**: Endosperm is the basis of most human food (rice, wheat, corn are all endosperm).
- **Propagation**: Adequate endosperm is critical for successful seed germination.
- **Ecology**: Seed size and endosperm reserves affect seedling establishment strategy.
