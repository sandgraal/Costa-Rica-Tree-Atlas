## What is Symbiosis?

Symbiosis describes intimate relationships between different species that live in close association. These partnerships have evolved over millions of years and are essential to tropical forest ecology.

## Types of Symbiosis

### Mutualism (Both Benefit) ✅✅

Both species gain advantages and the relationship is mutually beneficial.

### Commensalism (One Benefits, Other Neutral) ✅◯

One species benefits while the other is neither helped nor harmed.

### Parasitism (One Benefits, Other Harmed) ✅❌

One organism benefits at the expense of the other, causing harm but usually not death.

## Costa Rican Tree Symbioses

### Mutualistic Examples

**Guanacaste & Rhizobium Bacteria**:

- _Enterolobium cyclocarpum_ + nitrogen-fixing bacteria
- Tree provides sugars to bacteria in root nodules
- Bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen to usable form
- Both benefit: tree gets nitrogen, bacteria get food/shelter
- Result: Guanacaste thrives in poor soils

**Guarumo & Azteca Ants**:

- _Cecropia_ spp. + _Azteca_ ants
- Tree has hollow stems, produces food bodies
- Ants live inside, patrol for threats
- Ants attack herbivores, clear competing vines
- Classic defensive mutualism

**Fig Trees & Fig Wasps**:

- _Ficus_ species + species-specific wasps
- Wasp pollinates fig, lays eggs inside
- Fig provides food and nursery for wasp larvae
- Neither can reproduce without the other
- Co-evolved obligate mutualism

**Trees & Mycorrhizal Fungi**:

- Nearly all trees + soil fungi
- Fungi colonize roots, extend mycelial networks
- Fungi deliver phosphorus, water, minerals
- Trees provide carbohydrates from photosynthesis
- Critical for tree establishment and growth

### Commensal Examples

**Epiphytes on Trees**:

- Orchids, bromeliads, ferns on branches
- Epiphytes gain high-light position without soil
- Trees generally unaffected (unless overloaded)
- Epiphytes don't take nutrients from tree
- Common in Costa Rican cloud forests

**Birds Nesting in Tree Cavities**:

- Woodpeckers, parrots use tree holes
- Birds gain shelter
- Trees neither helped nor harmed significantly
- Old cavity trees important for wildlife

### Parasitic Examples

**Strangler Figs**:

- _Ficus_ spp. start as epiphytes
- Roots grow down trunk, eventually surround host
- Fig competes for light, nutrients, water
- Host tree often dies, fig becomes free-standing
- Parasite becomes independent tree

**Mistletoe**:

- Various mistletoe species on branches
- Mistletoe roots penetrate host bark
- Steals water and minerals from host
- Can weaken or kill small trees
- Birds spread seeds, continuing cycle

**Fungal Pathogens**:

- Various fungi attack living tissue
- Cause diseases like leaf spots, cankers
- Harm or kill host trees
- Natural population control

## Evolutionary Perspective

### How Symbioses Evolve

1. **Initial contact**: Species encounter each other
2. **Repeated interaction**: Contact becomes regular
3. **Natural selection**: Favors beneficial interactions
4. **Co-evolution**: Both species adapt to each other
5. **Obligate dependency**: May become unable to survive apart

### Specificity

- **Generalist symbioses**: Many partners possible (most mycorrhizae)
- **Specialist symbioses**: One specific partner only (fig wasps)

## Ecological Importance

### Forest Function

**Nutrient Cycling:**

- Mycorrhizae move nutrients between trees
- Nitrogen fixation adds fertility to ecosystem
- Decomposers break down dead material

**Structural Diversity:**

- Epiphytes create microhabitats
- Ant-plants provide insect housing
- Strangler figs create nesting cavities

**Pollination & Seed Dispersal:**

- Specialized relationships ensure reproduction
- Fig-wasp system supports wildlife
- Birds, bats, insects serve as partners

**Population Control:**

- Pathogens prevent species dominance
- Herbivores controlled by ant guards
- Balance maintained through competition

## Climate Change Impacts

### Threats to Symbioses

**Temperature shifts:**

- May desynchronize partners (flowers/pollinators)
- Fungi and bacteria sensitive to heat
- Could break apart evolved relationships

**Rainfall changes:**

- Mycorrhizae need specific moisture
- Drought stress weakens mutualistic benefits
- May favor parasites over mutualists

**Species range shifts:**

- Partners may migrate at different rates
- Could separate obligate relationships
- Creates ecological mismatches

## Why It Matters

Understanding symbiosis helps with:

- **Reforestation**: Must inoculate seedlings with mycorrhizae
- **Conservation**: Protecting one species requires protecting partners
- **Pest management**: Ant-plant systems provide natural pest control
- **Ecosystem restoration**: Symbioses must be restored, not just trees
- **Climate adaptation**: Maintaining symbiotic networks builds resilience
- **Biodiversity**: Symbioses multiply species diversity
