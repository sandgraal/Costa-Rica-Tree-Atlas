## What are Stipules?

Stipules are small structures found at the base where a leaf attaches to the stem. They appear in pairs (one on each side of the leaf) in many plant species.

## Types of Stipules

### Leaf-like Stipules

- Green and photosynthetic
- Can look like small leaves
- Example: Many Fabaceae (legume) species

### Scale-like Stipules

- Small, brown, and dry
- Often fall off early (deciduous)
- Common in many trees

### Spine Stipules

- Modified into sharp thorns
- Provide defense
- Example: Acacias and related species

### Modified Stipules

- Can become tendrils (climbing plants)
- May form protective sheaths
- Variable across plant families

## Stipules in Costa Rican Trees

### Legume Family (Fabaceae)

Many Costa Rican legumes like Guanacaste and Guapinol have small stipules at the base of compound leaves. These often fall off as the leaf matures.

### Fig Family (Moraceae)

Figs have distinctive stipules that form a protective cap over the developing leaf bud. When the leaf unfolds, the stipule falls off, leaving a characteristic scar around the stem.

### Malvaceae Family

Trees like Pochote and Ceiba have stipules that fall off early, leaving scars on the stem.

## Why It Matters

- **Identification**: Stipule type and persistence help identify plant families
- **Leaf scars**: Fallen stipules leave distinctive marks
- **Function**: Can protect buds, photosynthesize, or defend against herbivores
- **Taxonomy**: Presence and type of stipules are important taxonomic characters
