## What is Spalting?

Spalting is what happens when fungi colonize dead or dying wood and leave behind dramatic patterns — black zone lines, patches of white bleaching, and areas stained blue, green, pink, or orange. What was once considered a defect is now prized by woodworkers for its unique beauty.

## Types of Spalting

### Zone Lines

Thin, dark (melanized) lines marking territorial boundaries between competing fungal colonies. These are the most sought-after feature.

### Pigmentation

Colored stains produced by fungal pigments:

- **Blue-green**: Often from _Chlorociboria_ species
- **Pink-red**: Various basidiomycetes
- **Orange-yellow**: Other colonizing fungi

### White Rot (Bleaching)

Fungi that break down lignin leave behind pale, cellulose-rich wood — creating striking contrast with darker zones.

## Costa Rican Context

The warm, humid tropical climate accelerates spalting:

- **Wet season**: Fallen logs spalt rapidly — sometimes within weeks.
- **Common substrates**: Balsa, Laurel, and other light-colored softwoods spalt beautifully.
- **Risk**: Over-spalting weakens the wood structurally; timing the harvest is key.

## Practical Significance

- **Artisan woodworking**: Spalted wood is prized for bowls, inlays, and decorative objects.
- **Structural concern**: Advanced spalting weakens wood — not suitable for load-bearing applications.
- **Controlled spalting**: Woodworkers can intentionally induce spalting by controlling moisture and temperature.
