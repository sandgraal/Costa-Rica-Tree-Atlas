## What is a Mast Year?

A mast year is a boom year for tree reproduction — when a population synchronously produces a massive crop of seeds or fruits, far exceeding the normal annual output. This overwhelms the animals that eat seeds (predator satiation), allowing many more seeds to survive and germinate.

## How It Works

1. **Accumulation**: Trees store resources over several low-production years.
2. **Trigger**: A climatic cue (drought, temperature shift) synchronizes the population.
3. **Mass fruiting**: Trees produce 10–100× more seeds than average.
4. **Predator satiation**: Seed-eating animals cannot consume the entire crop.
5. **Successful recruitment**: Surplus seeds germinate and establish.

## Patterns

- **Interval**: Every 2–7 years depending on species.
- **Synchrony**: Populations across wide areas fruit simultaneously.
- **Inter-mast years**: Very low seed production — "starvation years" for seed predators.

## Costa Rican Examples

### Roble Encino (_Quercus_ spp.)

Highland oaks display classic mast-year behavior, with heavy acorn crops every 3–5 years feeding Resplendent Quetzals, agoutis, and countless other species.

### Almendro (_Dipteryx panamensis_)

Mast fruiting events are critical for Great Green Macaws, which depend on large Almendro crops for nesting season food.

## Ecological Significance

- **Wildlife populations**: Mast years drive population booms in seed-dependent species.
- **Forest regeneration**: Most successful tree recruitment occurs in mast years.
- **Climate sensitivity**: Changes in mast timing signal climate disruption.
