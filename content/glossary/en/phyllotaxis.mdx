## What is Phyllotaxis?

Phyllotaxis is the pattern in which leaves are arranged on a stem. Different species use different arrangements — all evolved to maximize light capture while minimizing overlap between leaves.

## Main Patterns

### Alternate

One leaf per node, arranged in a spiral around the stem. The most common pattern in trees.

- **Divergence angle**: Typically ~137.5° (the golden angle).
- **Example**: Most tropical hardwoods (Almendro, Guapinol).

### Opposite

Two leaves per node, directly across from each other.

- Successive pairs often rotated 90° (decussate) to reduce shading.
- **Example**: Corteza Amarilla, and many Melastomataceae.

### Whorled

Three or more leaves at each node, arranged in a circle.

- Relatively uncommon in trees.
- **Example**: Some tropical shrub-trees.

### Distichous

Leaves alternate in two ranks (rows) along opposite sides of the stem.

- **Example**: Many grasses and some palms.

## The Fibonacci Connection

Phyllotaxis often follows the Fibonacci sequence:

- The spiral patterns visible in pine cones, sunflower heads, and pineapple scales follow Fibonacci numbers.
- The ~137.5° golden angle between successive leaves ensures minimal self-shading — a mathematically optimal arrangement.

## Costa Rican Examples

### Palma Real (_Roystonea regia_)

Spiral phyllotaxis produces the characteristic crown shaft — leaves arranged in a tight spiral at the trunk apex.

### Pino Caribeño (_Pinus caribaea_)

Needles arranged in fascicles (bundles) with a spiral arrangement on the branch.

## Why It Matters

- **Identification**: Leaf arrangement is a primary feature used in tree identification keys.
- **Light optimization**: Understanding phyllotaxis explains why some tree canopies are denser than others.
- **Biomimicry**: The mathematical perfection of phyllotaxis has inspired designs for solar panel arrays and architecture.
