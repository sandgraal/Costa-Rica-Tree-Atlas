## What is an Anther?

The anther is the pollen-producing tip of the stamen — the male reproductive organ of a flower. It contains pollen sacs where pollen grains develop. When mature, the anther opens (dehisces) to release pollen, which must reach a receptive pistil for fertilization.

## Structure

### Internal

- **Pollen sacs (microsporangia)**: Usually 4, where pollen grains develop.
- **Connective tissue**: Joins the two halves of the anther.
- **Tapetum**: Nutritive layer feeding developing pollen.

### External

- **Dehiscence types**: How the anther opens to release pollen:
  - Longitudinal slits (most common)
  - Pores at the tip (buzz-pollinated flowers)
  - Valves (flap-like openings)

## Anther Diversity in Costa Rican Trees

### Large, Showy Anthers

- **Ceiba**: Large anthers on long stamens accessible to bat pollinators.
- **Corteza Amarilla**: Bright anthers attract bee pollinators.

### Poricidal Anthers (Buzz Pollination)

- Some Melastomataceae species require bees to vibrate (buzz) the anthers to release pollen through tip pores.

### Tiny, Numerous Anthers

- **Guanacaste**: Many small anthers in each flower head, producing abundant pollen for wind and insect dispersal.

## Why It Matters

- **Pollination**: Anther position, size, and opening mechanism determine which pollinators are effective.
- **Taxonomy**: Anther characteristics are key features in plant identification.
- **Agriculture**: Understanding anther development is essential for controlled breeding and hybrid production.
