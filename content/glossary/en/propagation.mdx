term: "Propagation"
locale: "en"
slug: "propagation"
simpleDefinition: "The process of creating new plants from existing ones, either sexually (from seeds) or asexually (from cuttings, grafts, or other vegetative parts)."
technicalDefinition: "The multiplication of plants through sexual reproduction (seeds) or asexual/vegetative reproduction (cuttings, layering, grafting, tissue culture). Sexual propagation maintains genetic diversity but offspring may vary from parent. Asexual propagation produces clones identical to parent plant. Choice of method depends on species characteristics, desired traits, time constraints, and intended use."

## What is Propagation?

Propagation is how we make more trees—either from seeds (sexual) or from parts of existing trees (asexual). Different methods work better for different species and purposes.

## Propagation Methods

### Sexual Propagation (Seeds)

**Advantages:**

- Genetic diversity
- Disease resistance
- Easy for many species
- Natural method

**Disadvantages:**

- May not match parent traits
- Longer to fruiting
- Variable quality

**Best for:** Native reforestation, genetic diversity, species adapted to seed propagation

### Asexual Propagation

**Cuttings:**

- Stem sections root in soil/water
- Clones parent tree
- Example: Higuerón, Poró

**Grafting:**

- Join scion to rootstock
- Combines best traits
- Example: Mango, Aguacate cultivars

**Air Layering:**

- Root branch while attached
- Then separate
- Example: Guayabo, Mango

**Tissue Culture:**

- Laboratory multiplication
- Mass production
- Advanced technique

## Costa Rican Examples

**Easy from seed:**

- Guanacaste, Guayabo, Nance
- High germination rates
- Simple requirements

**Better from cuttings:**

- Many Ficus species
- Poró, Madero Negro
- Reliable rooting

**Require grafting:**

- Elite Mango cultivars
- Improved Aguacate
- Specialty fruit trees

## Why It Matters

Understanding propagation helps with:

- Reforestation planning
- Fruit tree cultivation
- Maintaining rare species
- Commercial nursery production
- Home gardening success
