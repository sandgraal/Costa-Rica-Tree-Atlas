## What Is Bipinnate?

Bipinnate leaves are complex compound leaves where the leaflets themselves are divided into even smaller leaflets. Think of it as "compound squared" - a compound leaf made of compound leaflets.

## Structure

### Components

- **Rachis**: Main leaf stalk
- **Pinnae**: Primary divisions (like branches)
- **Pinnules**: Secondary leaflets (the actual leaf segments)
- **Petiole**: Stalk connecting leaf to stem

## Why Bipinnate Leaves?

### Advantages

- **Light filtering**: Fine texture allows dappled shade
- **Wind resistance**: Small leaflets reduce wind damage
- **Water efficiency**: Can close individual leaflets to conserve water
- **Heat dissipation**: Large surface area helps cool the plant

### Common Families

- **Fabaceae**: Many legumes (Mimosa, Acacia types)
- **Caesalpiniaceae**: Tamarind, Royal Poinciana
- **Rutaceae**: Some citrus relatives

## Identification Tips

Look for these features:

- **Feathery appearance**: Extremely fine, fern-like texture
- **Multiple levels**: Leaflets divided into sub-leaflets
- **Movement**: Often fold up at night (nyctinasty)
- **Symmetry**: Usually even distribution of leaflets

## Famous Examples in Costa Rica

### Cenízaro (_Samanea saman_)

The rain tree has spectacular bipinnate leaves that fold up before rain and at night.

### Guanacaste (_Enterolobium cyclocarpum_)

National tree of Costa Rica displays classic bipinnate structure with fine, mimosa-like foliage.

### Tamarindo (_Tamarindus indica_)

Delicate bipinnate leaves give this tree its characteristic fine texture.

## Ecological Role

**Leaf litter decomposition**: Bipinnate leaves decompose quickly, rapidly cycling nutrients back to soil.

**Nitrogen fixation**: Many bipinnate species are legumes that fix atmospheric nitrogen.
