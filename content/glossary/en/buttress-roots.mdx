## What Are Buttress Roots?

Buttress roots are dramatic, triangular extensions that flare out from the base of tropical tree trunks. They look like giant wooden fins or walls radiating from the tree, sometimes extending 15-20 feet up the trunk and out from the base.

## Why Trees Develop Buttresses

### Structural Support

- **Shallow soils**: Tropical rainforest soils are often shallow with poor anchorage
- **Weight distribution**: Tall, heavy canopy trees need extra stability
- **Wind resistance**: Buttresses act like guy-wires, preventing toppling

### Nutrient Uptake

- **Surface area**: Increased root surface for nutrient absorption
- **Access**: Reach nutrients concentrated in upper soil layers

### Water Management

- **Channeling**: Direct rainwater toward root system
- **Storage**: Can store water and nutrients in tissue

## Identification Tips

Look for these features:

- **Location**: Primarily in tropical rainforest species
- **Size**: Can extend 10-20 feet from trunk base
- **Shape**: Thin, plank-like, triangular cross-section
- **Number**: Usually 4-8 major buttresses radiating from trunk

## Famous Examples in Costa Rica

### Ceiba (_Ceiba pentandra_)

The sacred World Tree of the Maya is famous for massive buttresses that can dwarf a person. The buttresses can extend 15+ feet from the trunk.

### Almendro (_Dipteryx panamensis_)

Costa Rica's tallest tree species develops impressive buttresses in mature specimens.

### Espavel (_Anacardium excelsum_)

Shows well-developed buttresses in old-growth forest settings.

## Cultural Significance

Indigenous peoples traditionally:

- Used buttress spaces as natural shelters
- Created drums by striking the hollow spaces between buttresses
- Considered buttressed trees as sacred gathering places

## Conservation Note

Buttressed trees are indicators of old-growth forest. Their presence suggests:

- Minimal human disturbance
- Mature forest ecosystem
- High biodiversity value
