## What is an Inflorescence?

An inflorescence is the way flowers are arranged on a plant. Instead of single flowers, many trees produce clusters of flowers in specific patterns.

## Common Types

### Raceme

- Flowers along a central stalk
- Flowers open from bottom to top
- Example: Some Leguminosae

### Panicle

- Branched flower cluster
- Multiple racemes branching off
- Example: Mango flowers

### Spike

- Similar to raceme but flowers have no stalks
- Flowers attached directly to main stem
- Common in palms

### Umbel

- Flowers radiate from single point
- Umbrella-like appearance
- Example: Some Araliaceae

### Head (Capitulum)

- Dense cluster of flowers
- Appears as single flower
- Example: Composites

## Why It Matters

- **Identification**: Inflorescence type helps identify tree families
- **Pollination**: Different arrangements attract different pollinators
- **Fruit production**: Understanding flowering helps predict fruiting
- **Timing**: Inflorescence development indicates seasonal patterns
