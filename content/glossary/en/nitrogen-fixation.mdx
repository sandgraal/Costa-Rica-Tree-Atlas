## What is Nitrogen Fixation?

Nitrogen fixation is a crucial ecological process where certain trees, primarily legumes, partner with specialized bacteria to convert atmospheric nitrogen into forms that plants can use. This is essential because although air is 78% nitrogen, plants cannot use nitrogen in its gaseous form.

### The Process

**Symbiotic Relationship**

1. Rhizobium bacteria colonize tree roots
2. Tree forms nodules housing the bacteria
3. Bacteria convert N₂ to NH₃ (ammonia)
4. Tree uses ammonia for growth
5. Bacteria receive carbohydrates from tree

**Benefits to Forest**

- Enriches surrounding soil
- Supports growth of neighboring plants
- Reduces need for fertilizers
- Critical for forest recovery

## Nitrogen-Fixing Trees in Costa Rica

Many important Costa Rican trees fix nitrogen:

**Fabaceae Family (Legumes)**

- **Madero Negro** (_Gliricidia sepium_): Fast-growing nitrogen fixer
- **Guanacaste** (_Enterolobium cyclocarpum_): National tree, fixes nitrogen
- **Cenízaro** (_Samanea saman_): Shade tree enriches soil

### Identification

Look for these features on nitrogen-fixing trees:

- **Root nodules**: Small bumps on roots (not always visible)
- **Compound leaves**: Often pinnate or bipinnate
- **Pod fruits**: Many produce legume-type seed pods
- **Family Fabaceae**: Most belong to the pea/bean family

## Ecological Importance

**Reforestation**

- Pioneer species in degraded lands
- Prepare soil for other species
- Accelerate forest succession

**Agroforestry**

- Improve soil fertility in farms
- Reduce fertilizer costs
- Provide shade for crops like coffee

**Soil Health**

- Add 50-200 kg nitrogen per hectare annually
- Improve soil structure
- Increase organic matter

## Using Nitrogen Fixers

**In Your Garden**

- Plant near nitrogen-demanding crops
- Use as "green mulch" by pruning
- Improve poor soils naturally
- Reduce fertilizer dependence

**Best Practices**

- Allow leaf litter to decompose on-site
- Don't disturb root nodules
- Combine with non-fixing species
- Monitor soil nitrogen levels
