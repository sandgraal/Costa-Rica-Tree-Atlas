## What is an Invasive Species?

An invasive species is a plant (or animal) introduced from another region that spreads rapidly and causes problems for native ecosystems.

## Characteristics

### Rapid Growth

- Fast-growing and competitive
- Outcompete native plants for resources
- Example: Melina in Costa Rica

### High Reproduction

- Produce many seeds or sprout easily
- Disperse seeds efficiently
- Establish quickly in disturbed areas

### Few Natural Controls

- No natural predators or diseases in new region
- Native herbivores may not eat them
- Allows unchecked population growth

## Impact on Ecosystems

### Biodiversity Loss

- Outcompete and replace native species
- Create monocultures
- Reduce habitat diversity

### Altered Ecosystem Processes

- Change nutrient cycling
- Modify water availability
- Affect fire regimes

### Economic Costs

- Damage to agriculture and forestry
- Costly control efforts
- Loss of ecosystem services

## Invasive Trees in Costa Rica

### Melina (_Gmelina arborea_)

- Introduced for timber plantations
- Escapes cultivation and invades natural areas
- Spreads along roadsides and forest edges

### Sometimes Problematic

- Teak (naturalized but controlled)
- African oil palm (in some regions)

## Management

- **Prevention**: Best strategy - don't introduce
- **Early detection**: Monitor new introductions
- **Rapid response**: Remove when populations small
- **Control**: Mechanical removal, herbicides (careful use)
- **Native restoration**: Replant with native species

## Not All Introduced Species Are Invasive

Many introduced species are beneficial or benign:

- Coffee (doesn't invade natural areas)
- Most fruit trees (stay in cultivation)
- Controlled plantation species

**Invasive** = Introduced + Spreads aggressively + Causes harm
