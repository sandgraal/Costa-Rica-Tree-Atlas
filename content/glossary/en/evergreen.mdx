slug: "evergreen"
simpleDefinition: "A plant that retains its leaves year-round, maintaining green foliage in all seasons."
technicalDefinition: "A perennial plant that maintains functional foliage throughout the year by shedding and replacing leaves gradually rather than seasonally. Individual leaves may persist for multiple years before being replaced."

## Concept Explanation

**Evergreen trees** keep their leaves all year long. While individual leaves do fall and get replaced, the tree never appears bare—there's always green foliage on the branches.

### How It Works

**Continuous Replacement:**

- Old leaves shed gradually
- New leaves grow continuously
- Tree always has full canopy
- Individual leaves may last 1-4 years

**Seasonal Variation:**

- May have growth flushes in certain seasons
- Can look denser or lighter at different times
- But never completely bare

## Evergreen vs. Deciduous

**Evergreen:**

- Leaves year-round
- Gradual leaf replacement
- Consistent appearance
- Continuous photosynthesis
- Example: Guayabo, Mango, Avocado

**Deciduous:**

- Drops all leaves seasonally
- Bare period each year
- Dramatic seasonal changes
- Dormant period
- Example: Guanacaste, Pochote, Oak

**Semi-Deciduous (Semi-Evergreen):**

- Drops some but not all leaves
- May be bare for brief period
- Variable based on conditions
- Common in seasonal tropics

## Why Be Evergreen?

**Advantages:**

- Continuous photosynthesis
- No energy spent regrowing all leaves
- Better in stable climates
- Year-round shade provision
- Continuous wildlife food source

**Trade-offs:**

- Must maintain leaves through dry season
- Needs consistent water supply
- Leaves more vulnerable to pests year-round
- Higher maintenance cost in some ways

## In Costa Rican Climate

Costa Rica's climate influences leaf retention:

**Caribbean Side:**

- Higher rainfall year-round
- More evergreen species
- Less seasonal stress

**Pacific Dry Forest:**

- Strong dry season
- More deciduous trees
- Water conservation strategy
- Some evergreens adapted to drought

**Cloud Forests:**

- Consistent moisture
- Predominantly evergreen
- Year-round cloud cover
- Cool, stable conditions

## Practical Considerations

**For Landscaping:**

- Year-round shade
- Consistent appearance
- Privacy screening
- Leaf litter throughout year (not seasonal)
- May need more water in dry season

**Wildlife Value:**

- Consistent shelter
- Year-round nesting sites
- Evergreen food sources for some species
- Winter refuge for migratory birds

## Examples in Costa Rica

**True Evergreens:**

- **Guayabo** (_Psidium guajava_): Evergreen fruit tree
- **Laurel** (_Cordia alliodora_): Mostly evergreen
- **Aguacate** (_Persea americana_): Evergreen with growth flushes
- **Mango** (_Mangifera indica_): Evergreen (introduced)
- **Most palms**: True evergreens

**Common Deciduous (for comparison):**

- Guanacaste (_Enterolobium cyclocarpum_)
- Ceiba (_Ceiba pentandra_)
- Pochote (_Pachira quinata_)

## Identification Tips

Look for:

- Full foliage during dry season (January-April)
- No bare branches period
- Old yellow/brown leaves mixed with green ones
- Consistent canopy density year-round

### Note: Semi-Deciduous Challenge

Many tropical trees are "facultatively deciduous":

- May drop leaves in severe drought
- Retain leaves in wetter years
- Behavior varies by microclimate
- Hard to categorize strictly

## Evolutionary Context

**Tropical Evergreens:**

- Common in stable, wet climates
- Leaves adapted to year-round function
- Often have tough, long-lasting leaves
- Efficient nutrient use

**Temperate Evergreens:**

- Often conifers (pines, firs)
- Needle-shaped leaves reduce water loss
- Adapted to year-round cold
- Different strategy than tropical species
