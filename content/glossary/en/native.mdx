## Concept Explanation

A **native species** is one that naturally occurs in a region as part of the evolved ecosystem. It arrived through natural processes—seed dispersal by wind, water, or animals—not by human transport.

### Key Characteristics

**Natural Presence:**

- Evolved in the region over thousands of years
- Part of the balanced ecosystem
- Has natural predators and diseases
- Provides ecosystem services

**Pre-Colonial Standard:**

- In the Americas, "native" typically means present before 1492
- Before significant European colonization
- Based on historical and fossil records

## Native vs. Related Terms

**Native:**

- Occurs naturally in multiple locations
- Example: Ceiba native throughout tropical Americas

**Endemic:**

- Native to ONLY ONE specific place
- Example: Ciprecillo endemic to Costa Rica
- All endemics are native, but not all natives are endemic

**Indigenous:**

- Often used interchangeably with native
- Sometimes emphasizes longer evolutionary history
- Can also refer to First Peoples

**Naturalized:**

- Non-native species that reproduces without human help
- Established but not native
- Example: Some mango populations

## Why Native Species Matter

**Ecological Balance:**

- Support native wildlife adapted to them
- Resist local pests and diseases
- Require less maintenance in natural settings
- Part of food webs and nutrient cycles

**Conservation Value:**

- Maintain biodiversity
- Preserve evolutionary relationships
- Support ecosystem resilience
- Cultural and historical significance

**Restoration Priority:**

- Used in reforestation projects
- Restore degraded habitats
- Support native wildlife populations
- Maintain ecosystem functions

## Native Trees in Costa Rica

Costa Rica has approximately **1,500 native tree species** in diverse ecosystems:

**Lowland Rainforest:**

- Ceiba (_Ceiba pentandra_)
- Espavel (_Anacardium excelsum_)
- Almendro (_Dipteryx panamensis_)

**Dry Forest:**

- Guanacaste (_Enterolobium cyclocarpum_)
- Pochote (_Pachira quinata_)
- Corteza Amarilla (_Tabebuia ochracea_)

**Cloud Forest:**

- Oak species (_Quercus_ spp.)
- Aguacatillo (_Persea_ spp.)
- Many endemic species

**Mangrove:**

- Red Mangrove (_Rhizophora mangle_)
- White Mangrove (_Laguncularia racemosa_)

## Commonly Confused: Native vs. Non-Native

**Native to Costa Rica:**

- Guayabo (_Psidium guajava_)
- Cacao (_Theobroma cacao_)
- Papaya (_Carica papaya_)

**Non-Native (Introduced):**

- Mango (_Mangifera indica_) - from Asia
- Coffee (_Coffea arabica_) - from Ethiopia
- Teak (_Tectona grandis_) - from Southeast Asia

## Using Native Species

**Landscaping Benefits:**

- Lower maintenance (adapted to local climate)
- Support native birds and pollinators
- Better drought/flood tolerance
- Fewer pest problems
- Preserve local character

**Reforestation:**

- Restore ecosystem functions
- Support wildlife corridors
- Carbon sequestration
- Water regulation
- Soil conservation

## Cultural Importance

Native trees often have:

- Traditional medicinal uses
- Cultural significance to indigenous peoples
- Historical importance in local communities
- Names in indigenous languages (Bribri, Cabécar)
- Folklore and traditional knowledge

### Legal Protection

Some native species are protected by:

- Costa Rican forestry laws
- CITES (international trade restrictions)
- National park regulations
- Harvesting restrictions
