## What are Rays?

Rays are bands of cells that radiate outward from the center of a trunk like spokes of a wheel. They transport water and nutrients horizontally and store starch reserves. In finished lumber, rays create the attractive "flecks" or "figure" visible in quarter-sawn boards.

## Structure

### Types by Size

1. **Uniseriate rays**: One cell wide — invisible to the naked eye.
2. **Multiseriate rays**: Many cells wide — visible as prominent flecks (e.g., oak, roble).
3. **Aggregate rays**: Groups of small rays appearing as one large ray.

## Visual Appearance in Lumber

- **Quarter-sawn surfaces**: Rays appear as broad, shiny flecks (ray fleck or silver grain).
- **Flat-sawn surfaces**: Rays appear as fine lines on the end grain.
- **End grain**: Rays are visible as radial lines from pith to bark.

## Costa Rican Examples

### Roble Encino (_Quercus_ spp.)

Large multiseriate rays produce the distinctive "silver grain" flecks characteristic of oak lumber worldwide.

### Teca (_Tectona grandis_)

Fine rays contribute to the smooth, even texture that makes teak a premier furniture wood.

## Practical Significance

- **Figure and aesthetics**: Prominent rays create prized decorative grain patterns.
- **Splitting tendency**: Wood splits more easily along rays; important for traditional shingle-making.
- **Drying defects**: Differential shrinkage along rays can cause checking.
