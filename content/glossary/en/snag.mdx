## What is a Snag?

A snag is a standing dead tree — one that has died but remains upright as it slowly decays. Far from being wasted space, snags are ecological powerhouses: they provide food, shelter, and nesting sites for hundreds of species.

## Ecological Roles

### Nesting Habitat

- **Primary cavity nesters**: Woodpeckers excavate holes in soft snag wood.
- **Secondary cavity users**: Parrots, owls, bats, and small mammals move into abandoned cavities.
- **Bee and wasp nests**: Hollow chambers host pollinator colonies.

### Food Source

- Decaying snag wood teems with beetle larvae, termites, and other invertebrates.
- Woodpeckers, anteaters, and bark-gleaning birds forage on snags.
- Fungi fruiting on snags feed insects and small mammals.

### Perch Sites

- Raptors use snag tops as hunting perches.
- Kingfishers perch on riverside snags to spot fish below.

## Snag Stages

1. **Recently dead**: Bark intact, hard wood — primary cavity excavation begins.
2. **Decay stage 1**: Bark loosening, heartwood softening — cavity nesters active.
3. **Decay stage 2**: Bark fallen, soft wood — more cavities, fungi fruiting.
4. **Hollow stage**: Trunk largely hollow — large cavity users (macaws, kinkajous).
5. **Collapse**: Snag falls, becoming a nurse log on the forest floor.

## Costa Rican Context

### Almendro Snags

Dead Almendro trees are critical nesting sites for the endangered Great Green Macaw — their large, durable trunks form cavities that persist for decades.

## Why It Matters

- **Biodiversity**: A single old snag can support dozens of species simultaneously.
- **Forest management**: Retaining snags in managed forests and plantations dramatically increases wildlife value.
- **Urban ecology**: Dead trees in parks and gardens are valuable if they pose no safety risk.
