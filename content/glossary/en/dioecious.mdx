simpleDefinition: "Plants that have separate male and female individuals - each tree produces either male or female flowers, never both."
technicalDefinition: "A reproductive system where a plant species produces unisexual flowers, with staminate (male) and pistillate (female) flowers occurring on different individual plants, requiring cross-pollination between individuals for seed production."

## What is Dioecious?

Dioecious plants have a "male/female" system like most animals. Some individual trees produce only male (pollen) flowers, while others produce only female (fruit-bearing) flowers.

## Understanding Dioecious vs Monoecious

### Dioecious (Two Houses)

- **Male trees**: Produce pollen, never fruit
- **Female trees**: Produce fruit/seeds (if pollinated)
- **Both sexes needed**: For reproduction
- **Example**: Holly - only females have red berries

### Monoecious (One House)

- **Same tree**: Has both male and female flowers
- **Self-sufficient**: Can self-pollinate
- **Example**: Corn - tassels (male) and ears (female) on one plant

### Perfect Flowers (Hermaphrodite)

- **Each flower**: Has both stamens and pistils
- **Most common**: Includes roses, lilies, most trees
- **Example**: Most fruit trees (citrus, mango)

## Costa Rican Dioecious Trees

### Papaya (_Carica papaya_)

The most economically important dioecious tree in Costa Rica.

**Male Trees:**

- Produce only pollen
- Never bear fruit
- Flowers on long stalks
- Often removed from orchards

**Female Trees:**

- Produce large fruits
- Need male nearby for seeds
- Can produce seedless fruits without pollination (parthenocarpy)

**Hermaphrodite Cultivars:**

- Modern cultivars often hermaphrodite
- Single tree can produce fruit
- Preferred for commercial growing

### Fruta Dorada (_Virola_ spp.)

**Male trees:** Smaller flowers, heavy pollen production
**Female trees:** Larger flowers, produce distinctive red-arilled seeds

### Other Examples

- **Aguacatillo** (_Persea caerulea_): Related to avocado
- Some **palm species**: Many palms are dioecious

## Practical Implications

### For Fruit Production

**Problem**: Need both sexes nearby

- Plant 1 male per 10-15 females
- Male must flower same time as females
- Wind or insects must carry pollen
- If only one sex, no seeds/fruits

### For Landscaping

**Consideration**: Male vs female selection

**Plant males if you want:**

- No messy fruits dropping
- No seedlings sprouting everywhere
- No wildlife attraction (sometimes)
- Example: Male ginkgo trees don't produce stinky fruits

**Plant females if you want:**

- Fruits for wildlife
- Edible harvest
- Seeds for propagation
- Example: Female holly for red berries

### For Conservation

**Challenge**: Population viability

- Need both sexes in population
- Small populations at risk (may lose one sex)
- Sex ratio important (too many males or females reduces reproduction)
- Cannot propagate from single tree

## Identifying Sex

### Before Flowering

- **Impossible**: Young trees show no external differences
- **Genetics**: Requires DNA testing or chromosome analysis
- **Wait and see**: Must wait for flowering (years)

### During Flowering

- **Male flowers**: Have stamens, produce pollen, no ovary
- **Female flowers**: Have pistil/ovary, no functional stamens
- **Flowers differ**: Often different sizes or arrangements

### After Flowering

- **Easy**: Only females have fruits/seeds

## Evolution & Ecology

### Why Dioecious?

**Advantages:**

- **Obligate outcrossing**: Prevents inbreeding
- **Genetic diversity**: Forces cross-pollination
- **Resource allocation**: Females invest in seeds, males in pollen

**Disadvantages:**

- **Pollination required**: Both sexes needed
- **Lower reproduction**: 50% of individuals don't fruit
- **Finding mates**: Pollen must reach distant females

### Frequency

- ~6% of flowering plants are dioecious
- More common in tropical trees
- Rare in annual plants
- Common in wind-pollinated trees

## Why It Matters

Understanding dioecy helps with:

- **Fruit production**: Know why trees don't bear fruit
- **Nursery planning**: Maintain both sexes
- **Landscape design**: Choose appropriate sex
- **Conservation**: Ensure viable populations
- **Identification**: Sex differences aid tree ID
