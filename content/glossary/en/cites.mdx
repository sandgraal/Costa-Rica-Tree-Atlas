## What is CITES?

CITES (pronounced "SY-teez") is an international agreement between 184 countries that controls trade in endangered species. If a tree species is listed in CITES, you need special permits to export its wood across borders. This protects threatened trees from being logged to extinction.

## How CITES Works

### Three Appendices

**Appendix I** (Most Endangered):

- Trade banned except for exceptional cases
- Requires export AND import permits
- Examples: Brazilian Rosewood, some orchids
- Very few timber species

**Appendix II** (Trade Controlled):

- Trade allowed with permits
- Export permit required
- Most CITES-listed woods here
- Examples: Mahogany, Cocobolo, Rosewood

**Appendix III** (Country-Specific):

- One country requests trade help
- Export certificate required
- Less commonly used

## Costa Rican CITES Trees

### Appendix II Listings

**Cocobolo** (_Dalbergia retusa_):

- CITES listed since 2013
- Export requires permit
- Valuable rosewood
- Overharvested historically

**Caoba/Mahogany** (_Swietenia macrophylla_):

- CITES listed since 2003
- Bigleaf Mahogany
- Most valuable neotropical timber
- Illegal logging major problem

**Cristóbal** (_Platymiscium pinnatum_):

- CITES listed since 2019
- Rosewood family
- Export restrictions
- Growing scarcity

**Dalbergias** (Rosewoods):

- ALL Dalbergia species listed 2017
- Includes Cocobolo
- Response to Asian rosewood crisis
- Protects lesser-known species

## Why Trees Get Listed

### Threats Triggering CITES

1. **Overexploitation**: Logging faster than regeneration
2. **High value**: Expensive wood = incentive to poach
3. **Slow growth**: Takes decades to replace
4. **Small range**: Endemic or restricted distribution
5. **Poor enforcement**: Weak protection in source countries

## Impact on Trade

### Legal Requirements

**Exporting CITES wood:**

- Obtain export permit from country of origin
- Prove legal harvest
- Demonstrate non-detrimental to species
- Track chain of custody
- Pay fees

**Importing:**

- Present export permit at border
- Import permit may be required (Appendix I)
- Customs inspections
- Documentation kept for years

### Penalties

**Violations:**

- Confiscation of wood/products
- Heavy fines (thousands to millions)
- Criminal charges
- Import/export bans
- International arrest warrants

## Exemptions

### What's Not Regulated

**Personal effects:**

- Musical instruments (traveling with owner)
- Small personal items
- Must meet weight/value limits

**Antiques:**

- Wood worked before CITES listing
- Must prove age (documentation)
- Still controlled in some countries

**Plantations:**

- Wood from certified plantations
- Requires plantation certificate
- Must be verified sustainable
- Reduces pressure on wild trees

## Verification

### How to Check if Wood is CITES

**Official resources:**

1. CITES Species+ database (online)
2. Check scientific name (genus + species)
3. Verify current appendix
4. Note: Listings change over time

**Key families often listed:**

- Dalbergia (rosewoods)
- Diospyros (ebonies)
- Swietenia (mahogany)
- Cedrela (Spanish cedar)
- Guaiacum (lignum vitae)

## Conservation Impact

### Success Stories

**When CITES works:**

- Mahogany: Illegal trade reduced 90%
- Awareness raised globally
- Incentive for sustainable forestry
- Funding for enforcement
- Protected area creation

**Challenges:**

- Illegal logging continues
- Corruption weakens enforcement
- Look-alike species issues
- Identification difficult
- Limited resources

## For Woodworkers

### Working with CITES Woods

**Best practices:**

- Buy from reputable certified suppliers
- Request documentation
- Save permits and receipts
- Don't cross borders without permits
- Consider alternatives (non-CITES)

**Alternatives:**

- Plantation-grown CITES species
- Similar non-CITES woods
- Domestic species
- Certified sustainable sources
- Reclaimed/salvaged wood

## Costa Rica's Role

### National Implementation

**Forest Law:**

- All logging requires permits
- Chain of custody tracking
- CITES compliance mandatory
- Penalties for violations

**SINAC** (National Conservation System):

- Issues CITES permits
- Monitors wild populations
- Enforces regulations
- Works with customs

## Future Listings

### Trees at Risk

**Candidates for CITES:**

- Cocobolo relatives (other Dalbergia)
- Rare endemic hardwoods
- Overharvested species
- Climate change threatened

## Why It Matters

Understanding CITES helps with:

- **Legal compliance**: Avoid illegal trade
- **Conservation**: Support protection
- **Wood selection**: Choose sustainable options
- **Travel**: Know restrictions
- **Antiques**: Verify legality of old items

## Red Flags

**Signs of illegal trade:**

- No documentation
- Unusually cheap prices
- "Don't worry about permits"
- Secretive suppliers
- Crossing borders without papers

## Resources

**Check CITES status:**

- CITES website: cites.org
- Species+ database
- CITES app (mobile)
- National wildlife agency

**In Costa Rica:**

- SINAC offices
- Customs at borders
- Forest conservation police
- Environmental courts

## Consumer Power

**Support enforcement:**

1. Buy only documented wood
2. Ask for permits/certificates
3. Report suspicious activity
4. Choose plantation-grown
5. Support certified forestry
6. Educate others
7. Advocate for stronger protection
