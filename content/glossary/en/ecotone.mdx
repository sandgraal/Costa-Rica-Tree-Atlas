## What is an Ecotone?

An ecotone is the boundary zone where two ecosystems meet and blend — for example, where lowland rainforest transitions into cloud forest on a mountainside, or where dry forest meets wetland along a river. These zones are biologically rich because they contain species from both adjacent ecosystems plus specialists adapted to the transition.

## Characteristics

- **Environmental gradient**: Rapid change in temperature, moisture, or elevation across a short distance.
- **Species overlap**: Plants and animals from both adjacent ecosystems coexist.
- **Unique species**: Some organisms are specialized for ecotone conditions.
- **Sensitivity**: Ecotones are among the first places to show effects of climate change.

## Costa Rican Ecotones

### Elevation Transitions

Costa Rica's dramatic topography creates sharp ecotones:

- **Lowland to premontane** (700–1,200 m): Transition between tropical wet forest and lower montane forest.
- **Premontane to montane** (1,500–2,500 m): Cloud forest begins; epiphyte load dramatically increases.
- **Montane to páramo** (3,000+ m): Treeline gives way to alpine grassland on the highest peaks.

### Habitat Transitions

- **Forest to mangrove**: Coastal ecotones where terrestrial and marine ecosystems mix.
- **Dry forest to riparian gallery**: Lush green corridors through seasonal brown landscapes.
- **Forest to pasture**: Human-created ecotones — the most common in modern Costa Rica.

## Why It Matters

- **Biodiversity hotspots**: Ecotones support high species richness from overlapping communities.
- **Climate indicators**: Ecotone shifts signal changing conditions (e.g., treeline migration upslope).
- **Conservation**: Protecting ecotones preserves connectivity between ecosystems.
