## What is Aromatic?

An aromatic tree has fragrant leaves, bark, flowers, or fruits that release pleasant odors when crushed, rubbed, or damaged. The smell comes from volatile chemical compounds stored in the plant tissues.

## Identifying Aromatic Trees

### The Crush Test

1. **Pick a leaf** (with permission)
2. **Crush gently** between fingers
3. **Smell immediately** - do you detect fragrance?
4. **Strong smell** = aromatic
5. **No smell or "green" smell** = not aromatic

**Safety note:** Some aromatic trees cause skin irritation (like Mango family). Wash hands after testing unknown species.

## Common Aromatic Families in Costa Rica

### Highly Aromatic Families

**Lauraceae (Laurel/Avocado family):**

- Nearly all species aromatic
- Examples: Aguacate, Aguacatillo, Laurel
- Spicy, camphor-like scents
- Contains potent essential oils

**Myrtaceae (Guava family):**

- Most species aromatic
- Examples: Guayabo, Pomarrosa, Eucalyptus
- Eucalyptus-like, medicinal scents
- Rich in volatile terpenes

**Rutaceae (Citrus family):**

- All species aromatic
- Examples: Naranja, Limón, Toronja
- Citrus fragrance
- Oil glands visible in leaves

**Anacardiaceae (Cashew family):**

- Many species aromatic
- Examples: Mango, Marañón, Jobo
- Resinous, turpentine-like
- Can cause skin reactions

## Types of Aromatic Scents

### Scent Categories

**Citrus:**

- Lemon, orange, lime fragrances
- Rutaceae family
- Fresh, clean smell

- Example: Guayabo

**Resinous:**

- Turpentine, pine, balsam
- Burseraceae, Anacardiaceae
- Sticky, pungent smell
- Example: Indio Desnudo, Mango

**Anise/Licorice:**

- Example: Some Piper species

## Why Are Trees Aromatic?

### Functions of Aromatic Compounds

**Defense against herbivores:**

- Volatile oils deter insects
- Toxic or repellent to many animals
- Protects leaves from damage

**Antimicrobial protection:**

- Prevents fungal and bacterial infection
- Keeps plant tissues healthy
- Important in humid tropics

**Communication:**

- Signals to pollinators
- Warnings to other plants
- Attracts beneficial insects

**Human uses:**

- Medicine and healing
- Cooking and flavoring
- Perfumes and cosmetics
- Insect repellents

## Costa Rican Examples

### Strongly Aromatic Trees

**Aguacate** (_Persea americana_):

- Leaves very aromatic when crushed
- Anise/licorice scent
- Used in traditional cooking
- Lauraceae family

**Guayabo** (_Psidium guajava_):

- Distinctive medicinal scent
- Crushed leaves smell like guava fruit
- Used for teas
- Myrtaceae family

**Naranja** (_Citrus sinensis_):

- Classic citrus fragrance
- Leaves and fruit aromatic
- Oil glands visible
- Rutaceae family

**Laurel** (_Cordia alliodora_):

- Mildly aromatic wood
- Fresh-cut wood fragrant
- Important timber tree

## Field Identification Tips

### Using Aroma for ID

**Diagnostic value:**

- Family-level identification (Lauraceae, Myrtaceae, Rutaceae)
- Sometimes species-specific scents
- Quick field test for confirmation

**How to test safely:**

1. Start with gentle rub (don't crush immediately)
2. Smell your fingers (don't inhale directly from leaf)
3. Wait a moment for oils to volatilize
4. Note the type and strength of scent
5. Wash hands afterward

**Document the scent:**

- "Strongly aromatic, citrus-like"
- "Mildly aromatic, spicy"
- "Very aromatic, medicinal eucalyptus scent"

## Traditional Uses of Aromatic Trees

### Costa Rican Ethnobotany

**Medicinal teas:**

- Guayabo leaves for diarrhea
- Aguacate leaves for coughs
- Eucalyptus for respiratory issues

**Cooking:**

- Aguacate leaves flavor beans
- Citrus zest for beverages
- Aromatic woods for smoking meat

**Insect repellent:**

- Crushed aromatic leaves
- Hung in homes or worn
- Natural mosquito deterrent

**Ceremonial:**

- Aromatic smoke for cleansing
- Indigenous spiritual practices
- Purification rituals

## Chemical Basis

### What Makes Them Aromatic?

**Volatile compounds:**

- **Terpenes**: Most common (limonene, pinene, eucalyptol)
- **Phenolics**: Eugenol (clove scent), thymol
- **Alkaloids**: Some species
- **Esters**: Fruity scents

**Storage structures:**

- **Oil glands**: Visible dots on leaves (Rutaceae)
- **Resin ducts**: Internal channels (Burseraceae)
- **Trichomes**: Glandular hairs (some Lamiaceae)
- **Scattered cells**: Throughout leaf tissue (Lauraceae)

## Practical Applications

### Modern Uses

**Essential oil production:**

- Commercial extraction
- Perfume and cosmetics industry
- Aromatherapy products

**Natural pesticides:**

- Organic agriculture
- Botanical insecticides
- Eco-friendly pest control

**Food industry:**

- Flavoring agents
- Natural preservatives
- Spices and condiments

## Common Mistakes

**Don't confuse:**

- "Green" smell (all crushed leaves) with true aromatic
- Resinous sticky with aromatic (can be different)
- Strong smell with pleasant smell (some are unpleasant)
- Flower fragrance with leaf aroma (different sources)

**Remember:**

- True aromatic = distinctive, pleasant odor from leaves/bark
- Must be released by crushing/bruising
- Family-level characteristic often diagnostic
- Always test safely (skin reactions possible)

## Why It Matters

Understanding aromatic characteristics helps with:

- **Tree identification**: Family-level diagnostic
- **Traditional knowledge**: Connects to ethnobotany
- **Practical uses**: Medicine, cooking, repellents
- **Ecological understanding**: Defense mechanisms
- **Commercial potential**: Essential oils, products
