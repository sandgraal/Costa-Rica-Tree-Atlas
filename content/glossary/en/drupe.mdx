## What is a Drupe?

A drupe is a type of fruit commonly called a "stone fruit" because it has a hard pit in the center. The fruit has three layers protecting the seed inside the stone.

## Structure

### Three Layers

1. **Exocarp** (skin): Thin outer layer, can be smooth or fuzzy
2. **Mesocarp** (flesh): Thick, fleshy, edible middle layer
3. **Endocarp** (pit/stone): Hard, woody inner layer protecting the seed

## Common Examples

**Temperate Drupes:**

- Peaches, plums, cherries, apricots
- Olives

**Tropical Drupes:**

- Mangoes, jocotes, coconuts
- Coffee cherries

## Costa Rican Tree Drupes

### Jocote (_Spondias_ spp.)

Small egg-shaped drupes with thin skin, juicy yellow-orange flesh, and fibrous pit. A beloved Costa Rican fruit.

### Mango (_Mangifera indica_)

Large drupes with smooth skin, sweet orange flesh, and large flat pit. Introduced but widely naturalized.

### Aguacate/Avocado (_Persea americana_)

Technically a drupe! The "pit" is the stone, surrounding a single large seed.

## Why It Matters

Understanding drupe structure helps with:

- **Seed dispersal**: Animals eat flesh, disperse seeds
- **Propagation**: Seeds must be extracted from endocarp
- **Identification**: Drupes indicate specific plant families
