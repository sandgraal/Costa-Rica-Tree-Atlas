## What is Heartwood?

Heartwood is the dark, dense wood in the center of a tree trunk. It's the "heart" of the tree - no longer alive but providing strength and durability.

## Formation Process

### From Sapwood to Heartwood

As trees grow, inner sapwood gradually converts to heartwood:

1. **Living sapwood** transports water and nutrients
2. **Cells die** as outer layers add new sapwood
3. **Chemical changes** deposit extractives (tannins, resins, oils)
4. **Color darkens** due to these compounds
5. **Density increases** making wood harder and more durable

## Characteristics

### Physical Properties

- **Dense and hard**: Stronger than sapwood
- **Dark colored**: Brown, red, purple, or black
- **Dry**: No longer contains water
- **Aromatic**: Often fragrant from oils and resins

### Durability

- **Decay resistant**: Extractives prevent rot
- **Insect resistant**: Less attractive to borers
- **Stable**: Less prone to warping
- **Long-lasting**: Can endure for centuries

## Valuable Heartwoods in Costa Rica

### Cocobolo (_Dalbergia retusa_)

- Orange-red to deep purple heartwood
- Extremely dense and oily
- Highly valued for fine woodworking
- CITES protected

### Teak (_Tectona grandis_)

- Golden-brown heartwood
- Rich in natural oils
- Excellent for outdoor furniture
- Plantation grown

### Cedro (_Cedrela odorata_)

- Aromatic, cedar-scented
- Light to dark red-brown
- Resistant to termites
- Traditional boat building

## Heartwood vs. Sapwood

| Feature    | Heartwood          | Sapwood                  |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Function   | Structural support | Water/nutrient transport |
| Status     | Dead cells         | Living cells             |
| Color      | Dark               | Light                    |
| Density    | High               | Lower                    |
| Durability | Excellent          | Poor                     |
| Value      | High               | Low                      |

## Commercial Importance

- **Premium lumber**: Most valuable part of tree
- **Furniture and construction**: Preferred for quality work
- **Musical instruments**: Tonal qualities
- **Carvings**: Dense and workable
- **Durability products**: Outdoor decking, boats

## Why It Matters

- **Tree identification**: Heartwood color helps ID species
- **Timber selection**: Choose for appropriate uses
- **Conservation**: Old-growth trees have more heartwood
- **Sustainability**: Young trees have less valuable heartwood
