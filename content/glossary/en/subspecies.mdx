## What is a Subspecies?

A subspecies is a recognizable geographic variant within a species. It looks different enough from other populations to merit a separate name, but can still interbreed with them where ranges overlap. Subspecies are written as a third part of the scientific name: _Quercus costaricensis_ subsp. _costaricensis_.

## How Subspecies Form

1. **Geographic isolation**: Populations separated by mountains, rivers, or other barriers.
2. **Local adaptation**: Natural selection produces distinct traits adapted to local conditions.
3. **Incomplete speciation**: Not enough divergence has occurred to prevent interbreeding.

## Subspecies vs. Variety vs. Cultivar

| Rank       | Origin  | Example                                   | Interbreeds? |
| ---------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Subspecies | Natural | _Q. costaricensis_ subsp. _costaricensis_ | Yes          |
| Variety    | Natural | _P. americana_ var. _drymifolia_          | Yes          |
| Cultivar   | Human   | _M. indica_ 'Tommy Atkins'                | Varies       |

## Costa Rican Relevance

### Altitudinal Subspecies

Costa Rica's extreme elevation gradients (sea level to 3,800 m) create conditions for subspecies formation — lowland and highland populations may differ significantly.

### Island Populations

Isla del Coco (Cocos Island) harbors endemic subspecies of several plant groups due to its extreme isolation.

## Why It Matters

- **Conservation**: Subspecies may warrant separate protection — losing one means losing unique genetic diversity.
- **Forestry**: Different subspecies may perform better at different elevations or in different climates.
- **Taxonomy**: Recognizing subspecies helps scientists understand how species evolve and diversify.
