## What is Lumber Grade?

Lumber grading is a quality control system that sorts wood into categories based on visual appearance and structural characteristics. Higher grades command premium prices; lower grades are used for applications where appearance doesn't matter.

## Grading Systems

### Hardwood Lumber (FAS System)

**FAS (Firsts and Seconds)** - HIGHEST GRADE:

- 83% clear (defect-free) on worst face
- Minimum board size: 6" wide × 8' long
- Use: Fine furniture, cabinetry, musical instruments
- Costa Rican example: Premium teak, mahogany

**Select**:

- 83% clear on best face only
- Slightly smaller boards allowed
- Use: Furniture with one good face
- One face shows, one hidden

**No. 1 Common**:

- 66% clear on worst face
- Smaller clear areas acceptable
- Use: Furniture parts, flooring
- More affordable than FAS

**No. 2 Common**:

- 50% clear on worst face
- Significant defects present
- Use: Rustic furniture, paint-grade work
- Economy grade

**No. 3 Common (Below Grade)**:

- Less than 50% clear
- Heavy defects, many knots
- Use: Pallets, crating, utility purposes
- Cheapest grade

### Softwood Lumber (Different System)

Not common in Costa Rica, but for reference:

- **Select grades**: B&BTR (Best), C Select, D Select
- **Common grades**: No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

## What Graders Look For

### Defects That Lower Grade

**Natural Characteristics:**

- **Knots**: Size, type (sound vs loose), location, frequency
- **Pitch pockets**: Resin accumulations
- **Mineral streaks**: Discoloration from minerals
- **Wane**: Bark edge or missing wood on board edge
- **Shake**: Grain separation along growth rings
- **Insect damage**: Beetle holes, powder post beetles

**Processing Defects:**

- **Checks and splits**: Cracks from drying
- **Warp**: Cup, bow, twist, crook
- **Skip**: Saw missed section
- **Torn grain**: Rough, fuzzy surface
- **Stain**: Discoloration from fungi (not rot)

**Measurements:**

- **Board dimensions**: Wider and longer = higher grade possible
- **Clear wood percentage**: Amount with no defects
- **Defect size**: Larger defects lower grade more

## Costa Rican Hardwood Grading

### Premium Species

**Teca (Teak)** - _Tectona grandis_:

- Plantation teak often grades lower than natural forest
- Young plantation (12-15 years): Mostly No. 1-2 Common
- Old plantation (25+ years): Can achieve FAS
- Natural forest teak: Consistently FAS-Select

**Caoba (Mahogany)** - _Swietenia macrophylla_:

- Large, old-growth trees: FAS grade common
- CITES restrictions limit availability
- Highly valued for furniture and boatbuilding
- Even No. 1 Common sells at premium

**Cocobolo (Rosewood)** - _Dalbergia retusa_:

- Small logs limit grade potential
- Even Select grade commands high prices
- Used in small pieces (knife handles, jewelry)
- Grading less relevant due to high overall value

### Common Native Timbers

**Laurel** (_Cordia alliodora_):

- Wide range of grades produced
- Fast-grown plantation: More knots, lower grades
- Natural forest: Higher FAS percentage
- Very popular for local furniture

**Pochote** (_Pachira quinata_):

- Lightweight, even-grained
- Produces good percentages of Select-FAS
- Machines cleanly with minimal defects

**Melina** (_Gmelina arborea_):

- Plantation species, 8-10 year rotation
- Mostly No. 2-3 Common grades
- Many knots from fast growth
- Used for utility lumber, pallets

## Practical Implications

### For Buyers

**Furniture Projects:**

- **Visible parts**: Buy FAS or Select
- **Hidden parts**: No. 1 Common saves money
- **Paint grade**: No. 2 Common acceptable
- **Practice projects**: No. 3 Common for learning

**Construction:**

- **Framing**: Common grades sufficient
- **Flooring**: No. 1 Common minimum
- **Trim**: Select or FAS recommended
- **Decking**: No. 2 Common adequate if treated

### For Sellers

**Maximizing Value:**

- Proper drying reduces checking/warp
- Careful sawing reduces skip and tear-out
- Grading before sale ensures fair price
- Higher grades can sell for 3-5x lower grades

## Grading Certification

### Standards Bodies

- **NHLA**: National Hardwood Lumber Association (US standard)
- **Costa Rican mills**: Often use adapted NHLA rules
- **Export market**: Requires certified grading
- **Domestic market**: More informal, buyer inspection

## Why It Matters

Understanding lumber grades helps with:

- **Purchasing decisions**: Buy appropriate quality
- **Cost savings**: Don't overpay for grade you don't need
- **Project planning**: Estimate material costs accurately
- **Quality expectations**: Know what you're getting
- **Selling timber**: Get fair market value
- **Sustainability**: Lower grades reduce waste (use whole tree)
