## What Are Lenticels?

Lenticels are the tree's breathing pores - tiny openings in the bark that allow the living tissue underneath to exchange gases with the outside air.

## Appearance

### Visual Characteristics

- **Shape**: Usually oval, round, or elongated
- **Color**: Often lighter than surrounding bark (tan, white, or gray)
- **Size**: Range from barely visible dots to 1cm long
- **Pattern**: Can be scattered, horizontal lines, or vertical rows

### Texture

- **Raised**: Often slightly swollen or bumpy
- **Rough**: Cork-like texture
- **Variable**: Change appearance as bark ages

## Function

### Gas Exchange

- **Oxygen intake**: Living cells in trunk need oxygen
- **CO2 release**: Respiration products must escape
- **Replaces stomata**: After bark forms, stomata are lost

### Adaptation

- **Number increases**: More lenticels in oxygen-poor conditions
- **Size varies**: Larger in wet environments
- **Waterlogged response**: Can expand dramatically if roots flooded

## Identification Value

### Diagnostic Features

Different tree species have characteristic lenticel patterns:

- **Birch**: Prominent horizontal lenticels
- **Cherry**: Horizontal, cork-like lenticels
- **Indio Desnudo**: Conspicuous white lenticels on smooth reddish bark

## Common in Costa Rica

### Indio Desnudo (_Bursera simaruba_)

The famous "tourist tree" with peeling red bark is covered in prominent white lenticels that stand out dramatically.

### Guayabo (_Psidium guajava_)

Smooth bark with scattered raised lenticels.

## Interesting Facts

- **Name origin**: Named for their resemblance to lentils
- **Age indicator**: Lenticel patterns can help age trees
- **Flooding indicator**: Swollen lenticels suggest waterlogged roots
- **Always present**: All woody plants have lenticels once bark forms
