## What is an Annual Ring?

When you look at a tree stump, the concentric circles you see are annual rings. Each ring represents one cycle of growth — typically one year. The ring has a lighter inner portion (fast growth in wet/warm season) and a darker outer band (slow growth in dry/cool season).

## Ring Anatomy

### Two Parts per Ring

1. **Earlywood (springwood)**: Large, thin-walled cells produced during rapid growth — appears light.
2. **Latewood (summerwood)**: Small, thick-walled cells produced during slower growth — appears dark.

## Tropical Considerations

In Costa Rica, growth rings are less uniform than in temperate climates:

- **Deciduous dry-forest trees** (Pochote, Guanacaste) produce clear rings corresponding to the wet/dry cycle.
- **Evergreen rainforest trees** may form faint or irregular rings, making age estimates difficult.
- Trees at higher elevations with marked temperature changes often show clearer rings.

## Uses of Ring Analysis

- **Dendrochronology**: Dating trees and studying past climate.
- **Timber grading**: Ring width indicates wood density and strength.
- **Ecology**: Tracking drought years, fire history, and growth rates.
- **Conservation**: Estimating the age of old-growth specimens.

## Costa Rican Examples

### Teca (_Tectona grandis_)

Produces distinct annual rings, making it one of the easiest tropical species to date.

### Guanacaste (_Enterolobium cyclocarpum_)

Deciduous habit creates visible growth rings that correspond to the Guanacaste dry season.
