## What are Adventitious Roots?

Adventitious roots are roots that sprout from places other than the primary root system — from stems, branches, trunks, or even leaves. Many tropical trees rely heavily on adventitious roots for support, nutrient uptake, and colonization of new environments.

## Types

### Aerial Roots

Roots that grow from branches or trunk into the air before reaching ground:

- **Prop roots**: Grow downward from branches to provide structural support (Mangle Rojo).
- **Strangling roots**: Encircle a host tree's trunk (Matapalo, Higuerón).
- **Pneumatophores**: Upward-growing roots for gas exchange in waterlogged soils (mangroves).

### Stem Roots

Roots produced along stems in contact with soil:

- Common in plants that root from cuttings (living fences).
- Crucial for vegetative propagation in forestry.

## Costa Rican Examples

### Mangle Rojo (_Rhizophora mangle_)

Iconic prop roots arch from the trunk into tidal mud, stabilizing the tree in shifting substrates and creating nursery habitat for marine animals.

### Matapalo (_Ficus_ spp.)

Strangler figs begin as epiphytes, sending adventitious roots down around the host tree until the roots fuse and the fig becomes self-supporting.

### Higuerón (_Ficus insipida_)

Massive aerial root curtains hang from branches, reaching the ground to form supplementary trunks.

## Practical Significance

- **Propagation**: Many tropical trees are propagated from cuttings specifically because they readily produce adventitious roots.
- **Living fences**: Species like Madero Negro and Indio Desnudo root from large stem cuttings.
- **Erosion control**: Adventitious root systems stabilize riverbanks and coastal areas.
