## What Is a Cloud Forest?

Cloud forests are mystical tropical forests where clouds literally touch the trees, creating an ecosystem of constant moisture and unique biodiversity found only at specific elevations.

## Defining Characteristics

### Cloud Immersion

- **Persistent fog**: Clouds envelop forest for most of the year
- **Horizontal precipitation**: Trees capture water directly from clouds
- **High humidity**: Often 95-100% relative humidity
- **Cool temperatures**: Cooler than lowland rainforest (15-20°C)

### Elevation Range

In Costa Rica:
- **Lower limit**: Usually 1,000-1,500m
- **Optimal**: 1,500-2,500m  
- **Upper limit**: Up to 3,000m

## Why Clouds Form Here

### Orographic Lifting

1. **Moist air** rises up mountain slopes
2. **Temperature drops** with elevation
3. **Condensation** occurs at dew point
4. **Cloud base** forms at consistent elevation

### Trade Winds

- Caribbean trade winds bring moisture
- Mountains force air upward
- Cloud belt forms at predictable elevation

## Unique Features

### Water Sources

- **Cloud stripping**: Trees capture fog droplets
- **Horizontal rain**: Can equal vertical rainfall
- **Year-round moisture**: Even in dry season

### Vegetation Characteristics

- **Epiphyte abundance**: Mosses, orchids, bromeliads cover everything
- **Gnarled trees**: Stunted, twisted growth forms
- **Thick bark**: Protects from constant moisture
- **Drip tips**: Leaves shed water efficiently

## Biodiversity

### High Endemism

- **Isolation**: Mountains create biogeographic islands
- **Specialization**: Species evolve for fog conditions
- **Relicts**: Ancient species persist here

### Famous Species

- **Resplendent Quetzal**: Iconic cloud forest bird
- **Glass frogs**: Translucent amphibians
- **Thousands of orchids**: Incredible diversity

## Cloud Forests in Costa Rica

### Monteverde

- Most famous cloud forest reserve
- Protection of upper watershed
- Major tourist destination

### Poas Volcano

- Cloud forest around crater
- Magnolia poasana named for this location
- Unique high-elevation habitat

### Talamanca Mountains

- Largest cloud forest area
- Connects to Panama
- Critical biodiversity corridor

## Threats

### Climate Change

- **Cloud base rising**: Warming pushes clouds higher
- **Drought**: Cloud frequency decreasing
- **Species at risk**: No higher elevation to migrate to

### Deforestation

- **Watershed protection**: Cloud forests are water sources
- **Fragmentation**: Isolated patches vulnerable
- **Edge effects**: Altered microclimate at boundaries

## Conservation Importance

**Water supply**: Cloud forests capture and store water for communities below

**Carbon storage**: Dense vegetation sequesters significant carbon

**Biodiversity hotspot**: Irreplaceable species found nowhere else

## Visiting Tips

- **Bring rain gear**: You will get wet
- **Expect cool weather**: Temperatures can drop quickly
- **Look up**: Epiphytes in canopy are spectacular
- **Move slowly**: Fog limits visibility
- **Best time**: Year-round, but drier months (Feb-Apr) may have more breaks in clouds
