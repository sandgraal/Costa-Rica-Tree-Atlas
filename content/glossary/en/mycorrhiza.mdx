term: "Mycorrhiza"
locale: "en"
slug: "mycorrhiza"
simpleDefinition: "A symbiotic relationship between fungi and tree roots where the fungus helps the tree absorb nutrients and water in exchange for sugars from photosynthesis."
technicalDefinition: "A mutualistic symbiosis between plant roots and fungi in which fungal hyphae colonize root tissues, dramatically increasing the absorptive surface area and facilitating uptake of water and nutrients (especially phosphorus and nitrogen) while the plant provides carbohydrates produced through photosynthesis to the fungus. Essential for the survival and growth of most tree species."
category: "ecology"
pronunciation: "my-koh-RY-zuh"
etymology: "From Greek 'mykes' (fungus) + 'rhiza' (root), coined by German botanist Albert Bernhard Frank in 1885."

## Understanding Mycorrhizae

Mycorrhizae are one of nature's most important partnerships—invisible fungal networks that connect tree roots, helping them thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Over 90% of all plant species, including nearly all trees, depend on these fungal allies.

## How It Works

### The Partnership

1. **Fungus provides**:
   - Extended root system (hyphae can be 100x finer than roots)
   - Water absorption from tiny soil pores
   - Nutrient mining (especially phosphorus, nitrogen)
   - Protection from pathogens
   - Connection to other trees ("Wood Wide Web")

2. **Tree provides**:
   - Sugars from photosynthesis (up to 30% of production)
   - Stable habitat for fungus
   - Carbohydrates for fungal growth

### The Result

- Trees can absorb **10x more nutrients**
- Drought resistance increases dramatically
- Young seedlings can survive in deep shade
- Trees connected underground can share resources

## Types of Mycorrhizae

### Ectomycorrhizae (ECM)

- **Location**: Fungus sheathes root surface but doesn't penetrate cells
- **Trees**: Pines, oaks, birches, beeches
- **Visible**: Often form mushrooms (chanterelles, porcini, truffles)
- **Function**: Major role in temperate forests

### Arbuscular Mycorrhizae (AM)

- **Location**: Fungus penetrates root cells, forms tree-like structures (arbuscules)
- **Trees**: Most tropical trees, maples, fruit trees
- **Visible**: Never form mushrooms
- **Function**: Ancient partnership (400+ million years)
- **Dominant**: 80% of plant species use AM fungi

## The Wood Wide Web

Recent research reveals trees connected by mycorrhizal networks can:

- **Share nutrients**: "Mother trees" support their seedlings
- **Send warning signals**: Alert neighbors to insect attacks
- **Recognize kin**: Preferentially share with related trees
- **Redistribute resources**: From nutrient-rich to nutrient-poor areas

### Network Benefits

- Increases forest resilience
- Helps young trees establish
- Allows species diversity to coexist
- Buffers against environmental stress

## Why It Matters

### For Forest Ecosystems

- **Nutrient cycling**: Fungi break down organic matter
- **Soil structure**: Fungal hyphae bind soil particles
- **Carbon storage**: Mycorrhizae store carbon underground
- **Biodiversity**: Support complex fungal communities

### For Reforestation

- **Critical success factor**: Trees without mycorrhizae often fail
- **Inoculation**: Adding mycorrhizal fungi improves survival
- **Soil health**: Fungi restore degraded soils
- **Native networks**: Preserving existing fungal networks crucial

## Threats to Mycorrhizae

- **Soil disturbance**: Plowing, excavation destroys networks
- **Chemical fertilizers**: Reduce tree dependence on fungi
- **Pesticides**: Can kill beneficial fungi
- **Air pollution**: Acid rain damages fungal hyphae
- **Clear-cutting**: Removes host trees, kills fungal networks

## In Costa Rica

### Tropical AM Fungi

- Most Costa Rican trees use arbuscular mycorrhizae
- Critical in nutrient-poor tropical soils
- Help trees access phosphorus locked in volcanic soils
- Enable trees to grow in challenging conditions

### Conservation

- Protecting old-growth forests preserves fungal networks
- Reforestation projects increasingly inoculate seedlings
- Soil restoration includes fungal community recovery

## Practical Applications

### For Gardeners

- **Use mycorrhizal inoculants** when planting trees
- **Avoid tilling** to preserve fungal networks
- **Minimize fungicides** which kill beneficial fungi
- **Mulch with wood chips** to feed fungal networks

### For Foresters

- **Preserve forest floor** during logging operations
- **Leave "mother trees"** to maintain fungal networks
- **Inoculate nursery seedlings** before outplanting
- **Protect soil** from compaction and erosion

## Fascinating Facts

- A single teaspoon of healthy soil contains miles of fungal hyphae
- Some mushrooms you see are the "fruit" of mycorrhizal fungi
- Mycorrhizal networks can span entire forests
- Trees may "remember" their mycorrhizal partners
- Climate change affects mycorrhizal partnerships
- Truffles are mycorrhizal fungi (worth thousands per pound!)

## Visual Signs

You can't see mycorrhizae without a microscope, but signs include:

- **Healthy tree growth** in poor soils
- **Mushrooms** near tree bases (ECM type)
- **White fungal threads** in root zone soil
- **Enhanced drought tolerance** in trees
