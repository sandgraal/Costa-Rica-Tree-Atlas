## What is a Windbreak?

A windbreak is a deliberate planting of trees or shrubs in a line or belt to reduce wind speed. The sheltered zone behind a windbreak extends downwind for a distance of 10–20 times the windbreak's height, creating improved growing conditions for crops and better comfort for livestock.

## Design Principles

### Structure

- **Height**: Determines the extent of the sheltered zone.
- **Density**: 40–60% porosity is ideal — too dense causes turbulence on the lee side.
- **Length**: Should be at least 10× the height to minimize end effects.
- **Rows**: 1–5 rows depending on wind severity and available space.

### Species Selection

- **Outer rows**: Hardy, wind-resistant species with dense branching.
- **Inner rows**: Taller species for maximum height.
- **Understory**: Shrubs to fill gaps near the ground.

## Benefits

- **Crop protection**: Reduces wind damage and desiccation; can increase yields 10–30%.
- **Erosion control**: Reduces wind erosion of topsoil.
- **Moisture conservation**: Lower wind speed reduces evapotranspiration.
- **Livestock shelter**: Animals use windbreaks during storms and cold fronts.
- **Additional products**: Timber, fruit, firewood from windbreak trees.

## Costa Rican Applications

### Guanacaste Dry Zone

Windbreaks are essential during the dry season when strong trade winds desiccate crops and pastures. Pochote and Madero Negro are common choices.

### Highland Vegetable Production

In the Central Valley and Cartago highlands, Ciprés (_Cupressus lusitanica_) windbreaks protect vegetable crops from cold mountain winds.

## Why It Matters

- **Food security**: Windbreaks stabilize crop yields in wind-prone regions.
- **Connectivity**: Linear plantings serve as biological corridors for wildlife.
- **Climate resilience**: As extreme weather events increase, windbreaks become more valuable.
