term: "Quarter-Sawn"
locale: "en"
slug: "quarter-sawn"
simpleDefinition: "A way of cutting lumber where the log is divided into quarters and boards are cut roughly perpendicular to the growth rings."
technicalDefinition: "A sawmilling technique in which the log is quartered longitudinally and boards are cut so that the annual rings meet the face at angles of 60° to 90°, resulting in radial grain exposure, superior dimensional stability, and prominent ray fleck."

pronunciation: "KWOR-ter SAWN"
etymology: "From the practice of cutting a log into quarters before sawing boards, ensuring the grain runs perpendicular to the face."

## What is Quarter-Sawn?

Quarter-sawing is a method of cutting lumber where the log is first split into four quarters, then each quarter is sawn so the growth rings are roughly perpendicular to the board face. This produces lumber that is more dimensionally stable and often more visually striking than flat-sawn (plain-sawn) boards.

## Advantages

- **Stability**: Less cupping, warping, and seasonal movement.
- **Appearance**: Exposes ray fleck patterns — especially dramatic in oak and similar species.
- **Durability**: End-grain exposure on the face is minimized, improving wear resistance.

## Disadvantages

- **Yield**: More waste during cutting; fewer boards per log.
- **Cost**: Higher price due to lower yield and more labor.
- **Width**: Boards are generally narrower than flat-sawn from the same log.

## Costa Rican Applications

### Teca (_Tectona grandis_)

Quarter-sawn teak is prized for outdoor furniture and boat building due to its exceptional stability.

### Cristóbal (_Platymiscium pinnatum_)

Quarter-sawing reveals the deep figure and lustrous chatoyance of this premier furniture wood.

## Flat-Sawn vs. Quarter-Sawn

| Feature        | Flat-Sawn      | Quarter-Sawn       |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Ring angle     | 0°–30° to face | 60°–90° to face    |
| Stability      | Moderate       | Superior           |
| Ray visibility | Minimal        | Prominent fleck    |
| Board width    | Wider possible | Generally narrower |
| Cost           | Lower          | Higher             |
