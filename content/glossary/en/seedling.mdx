term: "Seedling"
locale: "en"
slug: "seedling"
simpleDefinition: "A young plant grown from seed, typically from germination until it develops true leaves and becomes more established (usually first 1-2 years)."
technicalDefinition: "The juvenile stage of plant development from seed germination through establishment of true leaves and initial root system. Characterized by dependence on seed reserves initially, then transition to autotrophic photosynthesis. Botanically defined as the period from radicle emergence until the plant is sufficiently established to be classified as a juvenile tree. Typically spans several months to 2-3 years depending on species and conditions."
category: "ecology"
pronunciation: "SEED-ling"
etymology: "From 'seed' + diminutive suffix '-ling' (small one). Literally means 'small seed' or 'young from seed.'"

## What is a Seedling?

A seedling is a baby tree—a young plant that has just sprouted from a seed and is in its most vulnerable early growth stage. It's the period from when the seed germinates until the plant is established enough to be considered a young tree.

## Seedling Development Stages

### Stage 1: Germination

- Seed absorbs water (imbibition)
- Radicle (first root) emerges
- Cotyledons may emerge or stay buried

### Stage 2: Cotyledon Stage

- Seed leaves provide initial energy
- First roots establishing
- Most vulnerable period

### Stage 3: True Leaf Stage

- First true leaves emerge
- Begin photosynthesis
- Less dependent on seed reserves
- Still considered seedling

### Stage 4: Established Seedling

- Multiple true leaves
- Substantial root system
- Independent of seed reserves
- Transition to "sapling" or "juvenile"

## Costa Rican Seedling Characteristics

**Fast-Growing Species:**

- Balsa: Can reach 1m in 3-4 months
- Gallinazo: Rapid early growth
- Large cotyledons
- Quick true leaf production

**Slow-Growing Species:**

- Almendro: Slow first year
- Many hardwoods: Patient growers
- Longer seedling stage
- Greater seed reserves

## Seedling Care

**Water:** Critical—never let dry out
**Light:** Match to species tolerance  
**Protection:** From herbivores, weather
**Soil:** Well-draining, nutrient-rich
**Spacing:** Prevent competition

## Why It Matters

Understanding seedlings helps with:

- Tree propagation and nursery management
- Reforestation success rates
- Species identification
- Conservation efforts
- Understanding forest regeneration
