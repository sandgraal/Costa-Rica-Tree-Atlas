## Visual Description

**Sepals** are the protective outer covering of a flower bud. They are the first parts you see when a flower begins to form, wrapping tightly around the developing petals and reproductive structures inside.

### Key Features

- **Usually green**: Most sepals are chlorophyll-rich and green like leaves
- **Tough texture**: Thicker and more durable than delicate petals
- **Outer position**: Form the outermost layer of the flower
- **Protective function**: Shield the developing flower from damage
- **Often reflexed**: May bend backward or fall off after flower opens

### Why Sepals Matter

Sepals are the **bodyguards** of the flower:

**Functions:**

- **Physical protection**: Shield delicate developing organs from insects, rain, wind
- **Temperature regulation**: Insulate the bud from cold or heat extremes
- **Water management**: Keep rain out of developing flower structures
- **Photosynthesis**: Many sepals continue producing energy via photosynthesis
- **Structural support**: Provide base for flower to sit on

## How to Identify

### Sepal vs. Petal

The key distinction:

**Sepals:**

- What you see BEFORE the flower opens (the green covering)
- Usually green, leaf-like
- Outer layer, base of flower
- Tough, protective texture
- Often hairy or fuzzy

**Petals:**

- What unfolds WHEN the flower opens
- Usually colorful and showy
- Inner layer, above sepals
- Delicate, soft texture
- Often smooth and silky

**Memory trick:** "Sepals Sit Below" (S-B-B)

### Sepal Count

Like petals, sepal number can indicate plant family:

- **3 sepals**: Some monocots
- **4 sepals**: Crucifers, poppies
- **5 sepals**: Most common (roses, legumes, many others)
- **Many sepals**: Magnolias (actually tepals)

### Sepal Persistence

**Deciduous sepals:**

- Fall off when flower opens
- Example: Poppies, some _Ficus_ species

**Persistent sepals:**

- Remain attached during flowering
- May even persist into fruit stage
- Example: Many _Tabebuia_ species, tomatoes, eggplants

**Accrescent sepals:**

- Enlarge AFTER flowering
- Help protect developing fruit
- Example: Tomatillo, some tropical fruits

## Identification Tip

When examining flowers:

1. **Look at buds first**: Sepals are most obvious before opening
2. **Check color**: Green usually means sepal, bright colors usually petal
3. **Feel texture**: Tougher = sepal, delicate = petal
4. **Count layers**: Outer layer = sepals, inner = petals
5. **Note arrangement**: Sepals often alternate with petals

## Examples in Costa Rica

**Prominent Sepals:**

**Legume Flowers:**

- **Guanacaste** (_Enterolobium cyclocarpum_): Tiny greenish sepals barely visible
- **Cenízaro** (_Samanea saman_): Small green calyx under pinkish-white stamens
- **Madero Negro** (_Gliricidia sepium_): Sepals form cup under pink pea-like flower

**_Tabebuia_ Species:**

- **Roble de Sabana** (_Tabebuia rosea_): Small green sepals at base of large pink trumpet flowers
- **Corteza Amarilla**: Green calyx at base of yellow flowers
- Sepals persist even as petals fall

**Colorful Sepals (Mimicking Petals):**

- **Some orchids**: Sepals colorful, look like petals
- **Heliconia** (not a tree): Bright red/orange "petals" are actually bracts and sepals

**Sepals Absent or Reduced:**

- **Figs** (_Ficus_ spp.): Flowers hidden inside syconium, sepals tiny or absent
- **Willows, Oaks**: Wind-pollinated, sepals much reduced

## Calyx Structure

The **calyx** is the collective term for all the sepals of a flower.

### Calyx Types

**Polysepalous (free sepals):**

- Each sepal separate
- Can count individual sepals
- Example: Rose, Buttercup

**Gamosepalous (fused sepals):**

- Sepals joined into tube or cup
- Form unified structure
- Example: Hibiscus, Morning glory

**Calyx Lobes:**

- In fused calyces, the tips may be separate
- These tips are called "calyx lobes"
- Number of lobes = number of original sepals

## Special Sepal Modifications

### Petaloid Sepals

Some sepals evolved to look like petals:

**Why?**

- Increase flower size without the cost of true petals
- Provide extra landing platforms
- Mimic multi-petaled flowers

**Examples:**

- Anemones: No true petals, colorful sepals do the job
- Some _Clematis_ species: Showy sepals, tiny or absent petals

### Sepals as Nectar Guides

In some flowers:

- Sepals have nectar guides (patterns visible in UV light)
- Help direct pollinators even before flower fully opens
- Provide backup pollination mechanism

### Spurred Sepals

- Some sepals develop spurs (tubular projections)
- Store nectar like petal spurs
- Example: Some orchids, Columbine

## Ecological Importance

### Protection During Development

Sepals are critical for successful flower development:

**Temperature extremes:**

- In Costa Rica's highlands, sepals protect buds from cool nights
- In lowlands, prevent overheating during day

**Herbivore defense:**

- Thick sepals deter chewing insects
- Some produce toxic or distasteful compounds
- Trichomes (hairs) make eating difficult

**Pathogen barrier:**

- Waxy coating repels water and fungal spores
- Tightly closed sepals prevent entry

### Post-Flowering Roles

**Fruit protection:**

- Persistent sepals protect developing fruit
- Can be seen on mature tomatoes, persimmons
- Accrescent sepals enlarge to shield fruit

**Seed dispersal:**

- Modified sepals may aid in wind dispersal
- Form papery wings or parachutes
- Example: Some _Dipteryx_ relatives

## Cultural and Practical Uses

### Traditional Medicine

In herbal medicine:

- Sepals often contain high concentrations of tannins
- Used in astringent preparations
- Example: Hibiscus calyx tea (Jamaica tea in Costa Rica)

### Culinary Uses

**Edible sepals:**

- Hibiscus (_Hibiscus sabdariffa_): Sepals dried for tea, jams
- Rich in vitamin C and antioxidants
- Tart, cranberry-like flavor

**Flavoring:**

- Some tree flower sepals add flavor to foods
- Usually more subtle than petal flavors

### Ecological Indicators

**Sepal damage** can indicate:

- Pest pressure (chewing, sucking damage)
- Disease presence (spots, lesions)
- Environmental stress (discoloration, premature drop)
- Useful for monitoring tree health before flowers even open

## Developmental Biology

### From Bud to Bloom

The sepal lifecycle:

1. **Initiation**: First floral organs to develop
2. **Growth**: Elongate to cover developing bud
3. **Protection phase**: Remain closed, shield interior
4. **Opening trigger**: Hormonal signals cause separation
5. **Maturity**: Reflex back or fall away
6. **Senescence**: May persist, change color, or abscise

### Genetic Control

**Flower development genes:**

- SEPALLATA genes control sepal identity
- Mutations can convert sepals to petals or leaves
- Understanding this helps explain flower diversity

## Identification Challenges

### When Sepals Look Like Petals

**Tepals:**

- When sepals and petals are identical
- Can't distinguish between them
- Solution: Call them "tepals"
- Example: Magnolias, lilies

**Undifferentiated perianth:**

- Some flowers have only one type of floral envelope
- May be all sepal-like or all petal-like
- Botanists count as sepals if outer, petals if inner

### Counting Sepals on Open Flowers

**Challenges:**

- Sepals may have fallen off
- Fused sepals hard to count
- Some hidden by petals

**Solutions:**

- Examine multiple developmental stages
- Look at buds for clearest view
- Cut through base to see fusion
- Check fallen flower parts on ground

## Conservation Note

**Sepal characteristics** can be taxonomically important:

- Used to distinguish closely related species
- Important for accurate plant identification
- Critical for conservation of rare species
- Document sepal features in botanical surveys

## Related Concepts

- **Calyx**: Collective term for all sepals
- **Perianth**: Combined sepals + petals
- **Bract**: Modified leaf below flower, different from sepal
- **Epicalyx**: Extra sepal-like structures outside true calyx
- **Receptacle**: The part of stem where sepals attach
- **Whorl**: A ring of organs (sepals form the outermost whorl)
