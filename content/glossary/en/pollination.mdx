## What is Pollination?

Pollination is nature's matchmaking service—the critical moment when pollen from a flower's male parts reaches its female parts, allowing fertilization and seed production. Without pollination, most of our food crops, garden flowers, and forest trees couldn't reproduce. In Costa Rica's forests, an intricate dance between plants and pollinators sustains incredible biodiversity.

## The Pollination Process

### Step 1: Pollen Production

**Anthers:**

- Male reproductive organs at top of stamens
- Produce thousands to millions of pollen grains
- Each grain contains male gametes (sperm cells)
- Pollen released when mature

**Pollen Characteristics:**

- **Wind-pollinated**: Tiny, smooth, lightweight, produced in massive quantities
- **Animal-pollinated**: Larger, sticky, sculptured surface, fewer produced
- Species-specific shapes and structures

### Step 2: Pollen Transfer

**Vectors (Carriers):**

- Wind (anemophily)
- Insects (entomophily)
- Birds (ornithophily)
- Bats (chiropterophily)
- Water (hydrophily)
- Other animals (zoophily)

**Landing Site:**

- Pollen must reach stigma (female receptive surface)
- Stigma often sticky to capture pollen
- May be highly selective (accepts only right species)

### Step 3: Fertilization

**Pollen Tube Growth:**

- Pollen grain germinates on stigma
- Grows tube down through style
- Reaches ovary (can take hours to days)
- Delivers sperm cells to egg

**Fertilization:**

- Sperm cell fuses with egg cell
- Forms zygote (fertilized egg)
- Develops into embryo
- Ovary develops into fruit
- Ovules become seeds

## Types of Pollination

### Self-Pollination (Autogamy)

**Definition:**

- Pollen from same flower fertilizes same flower
- OR pollen from different flower on same plant

**Advantages:**

- Guaranteed reproduction (no mate needed)
- Works in isolated situations
- Every individual can produce seeds
- Efficient in stable environments

**Disadvantages:**

- Reduced genetic diversity
- Inbreeding depression
- Accumulation of harmful mutations
- Less adaptability to change

**Examples:**

- Many agricultural crops (wheat, rice, beans)
- Some pioneer species
- Plants in marginal habitats

### Cross-Pollination (Allogamy)

**Definition:**

- Pollen moves between different plants
- Requires pollinator or wind
- Ensures genetic mixing

**Advantages:**

- Genetic diversity
- Hybrid vigor
- Adaptability to environmental change
- Disease resistance

**Disadvantages:**

- Requires nearby compatible plants
- Depends on pollinators/wind
- More energetically expensive
- Less reliable

**Examples:**

- Most forest trees
- Dioecious species (male and female plants)
- Many fruit trees

## Pollination Syndromes

### Wind Pollination (Anemophily)

**Plant Characteristics:**

- Small, inconspicuous flowers
- No petals or reduced petals
- No nectar or scent
- Feathery stigmas (capture airborne pollen)
- Exposed stamens
- Enormous pollen production

**Examples:**

- **Oaks** (_Quercus_): Catkins release clouds of pollen
- **Grasses**: All wind-pollinated
- **Palms**: Most wind-pollinated
- **Conifers**: Classic anemophilous

**Costa Rican Examples:**

- Highland oaks (Roble de Altura)
- Coconut palm (Coco)
- Grasses (various native species)

### Insect Pollination (Entomophily)

**Bee Pollination:**

- **Flowers**: Yellow, blue, white, UV patterns
- **Shape**: Landing platforms, tubular
- **Reward**: Nectar, pollen
- **Scent**: Sweet, fresh
- **Time**: Daytime

**Costa Rican Bee-Pollinated Trees:**

- **Guanacaste** (_Enterolobium cyclocarpum_): Ball-like flower clusters
- **Poró** (_Erythrina_): Bright red tubular flowers
- **Mango** (_Mangifera indica_): Small flowers, heavy honey production

**Butterfly Pollination:**

- **Flowers**: Bright red, orange, pink
- **Shape**: Long tubular, landing platform
- **Reward**: Nectar (no pollen collection)
- **Scent**: Light, pleasant
- **Time**: Daytime

**Beetle Pollination (Cantharophily):**

- **Flowers**: Large, bowl-shaped, primitive
- **Color**: White, cream, greenish
- **Scent**: Fermented fruit, spicy (attracts beetles)
- **Reward**: Pollen (beetles eat it), sometimes nectar
- **Structure**: Sturdy (withstand beetle movement)

**Costa Rican Example:**

- **Magnolia** species: Ancient beetle-pollinated lineage

### Bird Pollination (Ornithophily)

**Hummingbird Pollination:**

- **Flowers**: Tubular, no landing platform
- **Color**: Bright red, orange, pink (birds see red well)
- **Reward**: High-energy nectar (20-30% sugar)
- **Scent**: None (birds have poor sense of smell)
- **Time**: Daytime
- **Structure**: Sturdy (withstand hovering)

**Costa Rican Hummingbird-Pollinated Trees:**

- **Poró** (_Erythrina poeppigiana_): Brilliant red flowers
- **Madero Negro** (_Gliricidia sepium_): Pink tubular flowers
- **Corteza Amarilla** (_Handroanthus ochraceus_): Yellow trumpets (also bee-pollinated)

**Other Birds:**

- Some parrots pollinate while feeding

- Orioles visit some flowers

### Bat Pollination (Chiropterophily)

**Characteristics:**

- **Flowers**: Large, sturdy, open at night
- **Color**: White, cream, pale (visible at night)
- **Scent**: Musty, fermented, strong (bats navigate by smell)
- **Reward**: Copious nectar, pollen
- **Position**: Outside foliage (easy bat access)

- Travel long distances (gene flow)
- Critical rainforest pollinators

### Water Pollination (Hydrophily)

**Rare in Trees:**

- Mostly aquatic plants
- Mangroves (some species)
- Pollen floats on water surface
- OR underwater pollination

## Pollination Strategies

### Temporal Separation

**Protandry (Male First):**

- Anthers mature before stigma receptive
- Reduces self-pollination
- Common strategy
- Examples: Many Fabaceae (legumes)

**Protogyny (Female First):**

- Stigma receptive before pollen released
- Ensures cross-pollination
- Less common than protandry
- Examples: Some figs, magnolias

### Spatial Separation

**Herkogamy:**

- Physical separation of anthers and stigma
- Different heights in flower
- Different positions
- Mechanical barriers

**Dioecy:**

- Male and female flowers on separate plants
- Guarantees cross-pollination
- 50% of plants don't produce fruit
- Examples: Papaya, some palms

**Monoecy:**

- Male and female flowers on same plant
- Separated spatially or temporally
- Self-pollination possible but reduced
- Examples: Oaks, corn, some Pochote

### Chemical Barriers

**Self-Incompatibility:**

- Genetic system rejects own pollen
- Pollen won't germinate or grow
- Forces outcrossing
- Common in fruit trees

**Heterostyly:**

- Two or three flower forms
- Different anther/stigma heights
- Pollen from one form works on another
- Examples: Some Rubiaceae

## Pollinator Relationships

### Generalist Pollination

**Multiple Pollinators:**

- Flowers accessible to many species
- No highly specialized features
- More reliable (backup pollinators)
- Examples: Many temperate trees

**Trade-offs:**

- Less efficient pollen transfer
- Pollen may go to wrong species
- But more resilient system

### Specialist Pollination

**One or Few Pollinators:**

- Highly co-evolved relationships
- Very efficient pollen transfer
- Plant and pollinator depend on each other

**Examples:**

**Fig-Fig Wasp:**

- Each fig species has specific wasp
- Wasp breeds inside fig
- Only that wasp can pollinate that fig
- Perfect mutualism

**Yucca-Yucca Moth:**

- Moth actively collects and places pollen
- Lays eggs in ovary
- Larvae eat some seeds
- Plant couldn't reproduce without moth

**Costa Rican Example:**

- Various palm species and specific weevils
- Some orchids and specific bees

### Pollination Mutualisms

**Benefits to Plant:**

- Reliable pollen transfer
- To correct species
- Often long-distance (genetic diversity)

**Benefits to Pollinator:**

- **Nectar**: Energy (sugars)
- **Pollen**: Protein for larvae/adults
- **Oils**: Some bees collect floral oils
- **Resins**: For nest construction
- **Shelter**: Some flowers provide housing

### Pollination by Deceit

**No Reward:**

- Flower offers no food
- Mimics another flower
- OR mimics female insect
- OR traps and releases pollinator

**Examples:**

- Some orchids mimic female bees
- Trap flowers capture insects temporarily
- Carrion flowers smell like rotting meat

## Costa Rican Pollination Ecology

### Seasonal Patterns

**Dry Season Flowering (Dec-April):**

- Many trees flower when leafless
- High visibility to pollinators
- Competition for pollinators intense
- Synchronized flowering common

- Less competition
- Flowers may last longer (less heat stress)

### Altitudinal Variation

**Lowland Rainforest:**

- High pollinator diversity
- Many specialists
- Bat and insect pollination dominant
- Year-round activity

**Highland Cloud Forest:**

- Hummingbird pollination common
- Fewer bat pollinators
