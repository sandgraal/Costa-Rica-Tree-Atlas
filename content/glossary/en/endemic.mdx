slug: "endemic"
simpleDefinition: "A species that is found naturally only in one specific geographic area and nowhere else in the world."
technicalDefinition: "A taxonomic designation for organisms whose natural distribution is restricted to a defined geographic region, ranging from a single mountain to an entire country or continent. Endemism results from geographic isolation, specialized habitat requirements, or evolutionary factors."

## Concept Explanation

An **endemic species** lives naturally in only ONE specific place. It evolved there and is found nowhere else on Earth without human intervention.

### Scales of Endemism

**Micro-endemic:**

- Restricted to tiny area (single mountain, valley, or island)
- Example: Galápagos Giant Tortoise (one island)
- Highest conservation concern

**Country Endemic:**

- Found only within one country
- Example: Costa Rica has ~90 endemic plant species
- Costa Rica's small size makes country endemics rare

**Regional Endemic:**

- Found in larger region (e.g., Central America, Caribbean)
- More common than country endemics
- Example: Many cloud forest species

## Why Endemism Matters

**Conservation Priority:**

- If habitat is destroyed, species goes extinct GLOBALLY
- No "backup populations" elsewhere
- Requires focused protection efforts

**Biodiversity Hotspots:**

- Areas with high endemism are conservation priorities
- Costa Rica's cloud forests harbor many endemics
- Islands have highest endemism rates

**Scientific Value:**

- Endemic species reveal evolutionary history
- Show how geographic isolation drives speciation
- Unique adaptations to local conditions

## Endemic vs. Native vs. Introduced

**Endemic:**

- Found ONLY in one place
- Example: Ciprecillo only in Costa Rica highlands

**Native:**

- Naturally occurs in an area
- May also occur elsewhere
- Example: Ceiba native to all tropical Americas

**Introduced:**

- Brought by humans from elsewhere
- Not part of natural ecosystem
- Example: Mango from Asia

## Costa Rican Endemic Trees

Costa Rica has relatively few endemic tree species due to:

- Small country size
- Connected to continent (not island)
- Recent volcanic/mountain formation

**Notable Endemic Trees:**

- **Ciprecillo** (_Podocarpus costaricensis_): High-elevation endemic
- **Roble de Altura** (_Quercus costaricensis_): Cloud forest oak
- **Several Magnolia species**: Montane forest endemics

### Central American Endemics

More common category for Costa Rica:

- Species found only in Central America
- Includes multiple countries
- Shared evolutionary history

## Threats to Endemic Species

Endemic species face unique risks:

1. **Range Restrictions**: Small populations vulnerable to disasters
2. **Habitat Loss**: Entire species at risk if habitat destroyed
3. **Climate Change**: Can't migrate to suitable habitat elsewhere
4. **Specialized Needs**: Often require specific conditions
5. **Small Gene Pool**: Less genetic diversity for adaptation

## Conservation Status

Many endemic species are:

- **Endangered** or **Critically Endangered**
- Protected by international treaties (CITES)
- Focus of reintroduction programs
- Flagship species for habitat protection

### Costa Rica's Role

Costa Rica protects endemic species through:

- National park system (25% of country)
- Biological corridors connecting habitats
- Cloud forest reserves
- Research and monitoring programs

## How to Recognize

Look for species descriptions that say:

- "Endemic to Costa Rica"
- "Found only in..."
- "Restricted to [specific region]"
- Scientific names often reference locality (e.g., _costaricensis_)
