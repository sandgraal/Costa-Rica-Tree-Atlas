## What is Phloem?

Phloem is the tree's food-delivery system. While xylem carries water upward from the roots, phloem carries sugars and nutrients downward from the leaves to every living part of the tree — roots, growing tips, flowers, and fruits.

## How It Works

### Key Components

1. **Sieve tubes**: Long, connected cells that form the pipeline for sugar transport.
2. **Companion cells**: Metabolic helpers that keep sieve tubes alive and functioning.
3. **Phloem parenchyma**: Storage cells for starch and other nutrients.
4. **Phloem fibers**: Structural support (bast fibers used in traditional cordage).

### Transport Mechanism

Sugars are loaded into sieve tubes at the leaves, creating osmotic pressure that drives flow toward areas of lower sugar concentration (roots, growing points).

## Location in the Trunk

Phloem sits just outside the cambium, forming the inner bark. This places it in a vulnerable position — any damage that rings the trunk (girdling) cuts the phloem and starves the roots.

## Costa Rican Examples

### Guapinol (_Hymenaea courbaril_)

Thick, resinous phloem produces copious amber-like resin when wounded.

### Burío (_Heliocarpus appendiculatus_)

Strong phloem fibers (bast) are traditionally extracted for making rope and cordage.

## Practical Significance

- **Girdling kills trees**: Removing bark in a ring around the trunk cuts the phloem and starves the roots.
- **Latex production**: Many tropical trees (rubber, chicle) produce latex in specialized phloem cells.
- **Traditional fiber**: Bast fibers from phloem have been used for millennia in rope-making.
