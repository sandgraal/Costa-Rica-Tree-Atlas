## What is Latex?

Latex is a milky, sticky fluid that flows from wounds in certain plants. When you break a stem or leaf, white or colored liquid oozes out. This is latex - the plant's defensive system against herbivores and pathogens.

## Characteristics

### Physical Properties

- **Color**: Usually white, but can be yellow, orange, or red
- **Consistency**: Milky, sticky, often thick
- **Coagulation**: Dries and hardens when exposed to air
- **Composition**: Contains polymers, proteins, alkaloids

### Why Trees Produce Latex

**Defense Mechanisms:**

- Seals wounds quickly
- Deters herbivores (bitter taste)
- Traps small insects
- Contains toxic compounds
- Antimicrobial properties

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **Many latexes are irritating or toxic:**

- Skin contact can cause rashes
- Eye contact is dangerous
- Some cause severe allergic reactions
- Never ingest latex
- Wear gloves when handling

## Costa Rican Latex Trees

### Ficus Species (Figs)

**Higuerón** (_Ficus insipida_):

- White latex, mildly irritating
- Used traditionally as glue
- Low toxicity

**Matapalo** (_Ficus_ spp.):

- Copious white latex
- Moderate skin irritant
- Strangles host trees

### Other Latex Producers

**Papaya** (_Carica papaya_):

- Milky white latex
- Contains papain enzyme
- Mildly irritating to skin
- Used for tenderizing meat

**Hule** (Rubber Tree) (_Castilla elastica_):

- Historical rubber source
- Abundant white latex
- Pre-Columbian rubber production

## Latex vs. Sap vs. Resin

| Substance | Appearance     | Consistency | Trees        |
| --------- | -------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Latex     | Milky white    | Sticky      | Figs, papaya |
| Sap       | Clear or amber | Watery      | Most trees   |
| Resin     | Amber, sticky  | Thick       | Pines, copal |

## Historical Uses

### Traditional Applications

- **Rubber production**: Pre-Columbian ballgames
- **Glue**: Bonding feathers to arrows
- **Medicine**: Digestive enzymes (papain)
- **Waterproofing**: Coating fabrics and baskets
- **Chewing gum**: Chicle from sapodilla

### Modern Uses

- Natural rubber (Hevea brasiliensis)
- Papain enzyme extraction
- Pharmaceutical compounds
- Research on plant defense

## Identification Aid

**Latex-Producing Families:**

- **Moraceae** (figs, mulberries): White latex, often copious
- **Apocynaceae** (oleanders): White, often very toxic
- **Euphorbiaceae** (poinsettias): White, often caustic
- **Caricaceae** (papayas): White, enzyme-rich
- **Sapotaceae** (sapodillas): White to brown

## Field Safety

**When You Encounter Latex:**

1. Don't touch with bare hands
2. Keep away from eyes and mouth
3. Wash immediately if contact occurs
4. Assume toxic until proven otherwise
5. Use for identification but avoid handling

## Why It Matters

Understanding latex helps with:

- **Safety**: Avoid toxic exposures
- **Identification**: Family-level classification
- **Ecology**: Plant defense strategies
- **History**: Traditional material uses
- **Allergies**: Latex sensitivity awareness
