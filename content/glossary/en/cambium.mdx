## What is Cambium?

The cambium is a paper-thin ring of living cells just beneath a tree's bark. It is the engine of trunk and branch growth — every year it adds a new layer of wood on the inside and a new layer of bark on the outside.

## How It Works

### Two Types

1. **Vascular cambium**: Produces xylem (wood) inward and phloem (inner bark) outward — responsible for trunk thickening.
2. **Cork cambium (phellogen)**: Produces the outer protective bark.

### Seasonal Growth

In Costa Rica's tropical climate, cambial activity is often continuous but varies with wet/dry seasons:

- **Wet season**: Rapid cell division produces broad, light-coloured wood.
- **Dry season**: Slower growth produces denser, darker wood.
- These alternations create visible growth rings even in the tropics.

## Why It Matters

- **Tree health**: A damaged cambium can kill a branch or the entire tree.
- **Grafting**: Successful grafts require cambium layers of scion and rootstock to align.
- **Timber quality**: Cambial growth rate affects wood density and grain.
- **Dating**: Growth rings produced by the cambium can reveal a tree's age.

## Costa Rican Examples

### Cedro Amargo (_Cedrela odorata_)

Rapid cambial growth during the wet season produces the distinctive light-and-dark banding prized in furniture wood.

### Cristóbal (_Platymiscium pinnatum_)

Slow, consistent cambial activity produces the extremely dense, durable heartwood valued in fine woodworking.

## Cambium Damage

Common causes of cambial injury in Costa Rica include:

- **Machete wounds** during trail maintenance
- **Fire scars** from dry-season burns
- **Bark beetles** that tunnel through the cambial zone
- **Sun scald** on suddenly exposed trunks after logging nearby trees
