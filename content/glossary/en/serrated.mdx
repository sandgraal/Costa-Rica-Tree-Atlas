## What is Serrated?

Serrated describes leaf edges that have sharp, tooth-like projections pointing forward, similar to a saw blade. It's one of the most common leaf edge patterns.

## Types of Serration

### Serrate Variations

1. **Serrate**: Clear, forward-pointing teeth
2. **Serrulate**: Very fine, small teeth
3. **Biserrate**: Teeth have smaller teeth on them
4. **Crenate**: Rounded teeth (scalloped)

## Recognition

**Look for:**

- Sharp points along edge
- Regular or irregular spacing
- Forward-pointing direction
- Size and frequency of teeth

## Why Leaves Have Teeth

### Functional Benefits

- **Water regulation**: Guttation through hydathodes at tooth tips
- **Increased surface area**: More photosynthesis
- **Temperature regulation**: Heat dissipation
- **Defense**: Deter some herbivores

## Costa Rican Examples

### Roble Encino (_Quercus_ spp.)

- Deeply serrated margins
- Classic oak leaf pattern
- Teeth curve forward

### Cas (_Psidium friedrichsthalianum_)

- Finely serrated edges
- Small, regular teeth
- Guava family trait

## Serrated vs. Smooth

| Edge Type | Description       | Example Trees     |
| --------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Serrated  | Toothed, saw-like | Oaks, elms        |
| Entire    | Smooth, no teeth  | Mangoes, avocados |
| Lobed     | Deep indentations | Oaks, maples      |
| Undulate  | Wavy edge         | Figs              |

## Identification Tips

**Quick Check:**

1. Run finger along edge (carefully!)
2. Look for regular teeth pattern
3. Check if teeth point forward
4. Note tooth size and spacing

**Common in These Families:**

- Rosaceae (roses, apples)
- Fagaceae (oaks)
- Betulaceae (birches)
- Salicaceae (willows)

## Why It Matters

Understanding serrated edges helps with:

- **Quick identification**: Narrow down species
- **Family recognition**: Common in certain families
- **Leaf function**: Understand adaptation
- **Seasonal changes**: Some trees more serrated when young
