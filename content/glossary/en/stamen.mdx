## What is a Stamen?

The stamen is the male part of a flower that makes pollen. Each stamen has two parts: a slender stalk (filament) and a pollen-producing tip (anther). Together, all the stamens in a flower are called the androecium.

## Structure

### Two Main Parts

**Filament:**

- Thread-like stalk
- Supports and positions anther
- May be short or very long
- Can be fused or free

**Anther:**

- Usually two lobes
- Contains pollen sacs (microsporangia)
- Produces and releases pollen
- Opens by splits or pores

## Number and Arrangement

### Variation

**Few stamens** (1-5):

- Some orchids have one
- Many flowers have 5
- Efficient pollen production

**Many stamens** (dozens to hundreds):

- Ceiba has 100+ stamens
- Creates showy flower
- Backup for pollination

### Patterns

**Free stamens**: Each separate
**Fused stamens**: United in groups
**Monadelphous**: All stamens fused in one group
**Diadelphous**: Stamens in two groups

## Pollen Production

### Process

1. **Microsporogenesis**: Cells divide in anther
2. **Pollen grain formation**: Each grain contains male gametes
3. **Anther maturation**: Pollen ripens
4. **Dehiscence**: Anther splits open
5. **Release**: Pollen dispersed by wind, insects, birds

### Pollen Types

**Wind-dispersed** (anemophilous):

- Small, light, smooth
- Produced in huge quantities
- Major allergen source

**Animal-dispersed** (zoophilous):

- Larger, sticky, sculptured
- Less produced
- Attached to pollinators

## Costa Rican Examples

### Guanacaste (_Enterolobium cyclocarpum_)

- Many long stamens
- White, fluffy flower balls
- Stamens give spherical appearance
- Bee-pollinated

### Roble de Sabana (_Tabebuia rosea_)

- 4 stamens (typical for family)
- Two pairs of unequal length
- Hidden inside pink trumpet
- Bee-pollinated

### Cortez Negro (_Handroanthus chrysanthus_)

- 4 stamens
- Yellow anthers visible
- Inside purple-pink flower
- Large nectar reward for bees

## Function in Pollination

### Mechanisms

**Direct contact:**

- Pollinator brushes against anther
- Pollen sticks to body
- Transferred to pistil of next flower

**Explosive release:**

- Some stamens spring when touched
- Dust pollinator with pollen
- Trigger mechanisms

**Gradual release:**

- Anthers open slowly
- Pollen available over days
- Multiple pollinator visits

## Modified Stamens

### Staminodes

**Non-functional stamens:**

- Lost pollen production
- May be showy (petal-like)
- Can produce nectar
- Part of flower symmetry

**Example**: Some orchids have showy staminodes

## Timing

### Protandry

**Stamens mature first:**

- Pollen released before pistil receptive
- Prevents self-pollination
- Promotes outcrossing

### Protogyny

**Pistil matures first:**

- Receives pollen from other flowers
- Then stamens release pollen
- Also prevents self-pollination

## Identification Value

### Family Characteristics

**Fabaceae (legumes):**

- Usually 10 stamens
- Often fused at base
- Diagnostic feature

**Malvaceae (hibiscus family):**

- Many stamens
- Fused in column around pistil
- Very distinctive

**Bignoniaceae (trumpet trees):**

- Usually 4 stamens
- Hidden in tube
- One or two may be sterile

## Economic Importance

### Food Products

**Saffron** (spice):

- Actually dried stigmas (female part)
- But harvested from crocus flowers
- World's most expensive spice

**Pollen supplements:**

- Bee pollen collected
- Nutritional supplement
- From stamens of many flowers

### Allergens

**Hay fever:**

- Wind-pollinated tree pollen
- Major allergen source
- Peak seasons (dry-rainy transition)

**Costa Rican allergenic trees:**

- Cypresses
- Some palms
- Wind-pollinated species

## Why It Matters

Understanding stamens helps with:

- **Flower identification**: Number and arrangement diagnostic
- **Pollination**: Understanding reproduction
- **Breeding**: Controlled pollination for hybrids
- **Allergies**: Identifying pollen sources
- **Conservation**: Protecting pollinators

## Field Tips

**Examining stamens:**

1. Count them (diagnostic!)
2. Note if free or fused
3. Check anther color
4. Look for pollen
5. Measure length relative to pistil

**Best time to observe:**

- Early morning (fresh pollen)
- Peak flowering season
- Flowers just opening
