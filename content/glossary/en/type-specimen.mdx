## What is a Type Specimen?

When a scientist discovers and names a new species, they must designate a specific physical specimen — usually a pressed and dried plant mounted on a herbarium sheet — as the permanent reference for that name. This is the type specimen (holotype). If there is ever confusion about what species a name refers to, the type specimen is the ultimate authority.

## Types of Type Specimens

### Holotype

The single specimen designated by the original author as the name-bearing type. This is the most important type.

### Isotype

A duplicate collected at the same time and place as the holotype — often deposited in a second herbarium for safety.

### Paratype

Other specimens cited in the original description but not designated as the holotype.

### Neotype

A replacement type designated when the original holotype is lost or destroyed.

## Costa Rican Type Specimens

### Historic Collections

Many Costa Rican tree species were first described from specimens collected by 19th-century botanists:

- **Henri Pittier**: Collected hundreds of type specimens during his work in Costa Rica (1887–1904).
- **Paul Standley**: Described numerous Costa Rican species based on National Museum collections.
- **Adolfo Tonduz**: His collections at the National Herbarium include many types.

### Where They Are Housed

- **Herbario Nacional de Costa Rica (CR)**: National collection of Costa Rican plant types.
- **Field Museum (F), Chicago**: Houses many Standley type specimens.
- **US National Herbarium (US)**: Pittier's types deposited in Washington, D.C.

## Why It Matters

- **Taxonomic stability**: Type specimens anchor species names permanently.
- **Identification**: When a tree cannot be identified, comparison with type specimens may resolve the question.
- **Conservation**: Some type specimens are the only known record of species that may be extinct.
