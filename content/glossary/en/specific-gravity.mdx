slug: "specific-gravity"
simpleDefinition: "A measure of how heavy wood is compared to water — higher numbers mean denser, harder wood."
technicalDefinition: "The ratio of the oven-dry mass of a wood sample to the mass of an equal volume of water at 4°C, serving as a primary predictor of wood strength, shrinkage, hardness, and fuel value."

## What is Specific Gravity?

Specific gravity (SG) tells you how dense wood is by comparing it to water. Water has an SG of 1.00. Wood lighter than water (SG < 1.0) floats; wood heavier than water (SG > 1.0) sinks. Most woods range from 0.10 (balsa) to 1.30 (lignum vitae).

## Why It Matters

### Predicts Key Properties

- **Strength**: Denser wood is generally stronger.
- **Hardness**: Higher SG correlates with higher Janka hardness.
- **Workability**: Very dense woods dull tools faster but take a superb polish.
- **Fuel value**: Denser wood produces more heat per volume.
- **Shrinkage**: Denser woods shrink and swell more with moisture changes.

## Costa Rican Examples

| Species      | SG   | Classification  |
| ------------ | ---- | --------------- |
| Balsa        | 0.10 | Extremely light |
| Laurel       | 0.42 | Light           |
| Cedro Amargo | 0.47 | Medium-light    |
| Teca         | 0.55 | Medium          |
| Guapinol     | 0.76 | Heavy           |
| Cocobolo     | 1.10 | Very heavy      |
| Nazareno     | 0.91 | Heavy           |

## Practical Applications

- **Construction**: Medium SG woods (0.40–0.60) balance strength and weight for structural framing.
- **Fine furniture**: High SG woods (0.70+) take detailed carving and polishing.
- **Firewood**: Higher SG burns longer and produces more energy.
- **Flooring**: High SG required for durability underfoot.

## Measurement

Specific gravity is measured by weighing an oven-dried sample and dividing by the weight of an equal volume of water. In Costa Rica, the standard reference is green volume / oven-dry weight.
