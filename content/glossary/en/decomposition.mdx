## What is Decomposition?

Decomposition is nature's recycling system — the process that breaks down fallen leaves, branches, dead trees, and other organic matter into nutrients that feed the next generation of growth. In tropical forests like those of Costa Rica, decomposition is extraordinarily fast due to warm temperatures and high moisture.

## The Process

### Decomposer Community

1. **Fungi**: Primary decomposers; break down cellulose and lignin.
2. **Bacteria**: Carry out chemical transformations and nutrient mineralization.
3. **Invertebrates**: Termites, beetles, millipedes, and earthworms fragment material and increase surface area.
4. **Microarthropods**: Mites and springtails graze on fungal hyphae and bacteria.

### Stages

1. **Fragmentation**: Physical breakup by animals and weather.
2. **Leaching**: Soluble compounds wash away in rain.
3. **Catabolism**: Microorganisms chemically break down complex molecules.
4. **Mineralization**: Nutrients released into soil in plant-available forms.

## Tropical vs. Temperate Decomposition

| Factor             | Tropical (Costa Rica) | Temperate                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Leaf litter rate   | 2–6 months            | 1–3 years                 |
| Log decay          | 5–15 years            | 20–100 years              |
| Key decomposers    | Fungi + termites      | Fungi + earthworms        |
| Soil organic layer | Thin (rapid turnover) | Thick (slow accumulation) |

## Costa Rican Context

- **Rainforest floors** have surprisingly thin litter layers because decomposition keeps pace with leaf fall.
- **Termite mounds** are major decomposition engines in lowland forests.
- **Balsa** logs decompose within 2–3 years due to low-density wood and fast fungal colonization.

## Why It Matters

- **Nutrient cycling**: Returns essential elements (N, P, K) to the soil, sustaining forest productivity.
- **Carbon cycle**: Releases CO₂ back to the atmosphere while sequestering carbon in soil.
- **Soil formation**: Decomposition products (humus) build and maintain soil structure.
