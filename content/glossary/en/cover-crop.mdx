## What is a Cover Crop?

A cover crop is a plant grown not for harvest but to protect and improve the soil. In tropical agroforestry, cover crops blanket the ground beneath tree canopies, preventing erosion, suppressing weeds, and fixing nitrogen.

## Types

### Leguminous Cover Crops (Nitrogen-Fixing)

- **Mucuna** (_Mucuna pruriens_): Velvet bean — vigorous vine that smothers weeds and fixes large amounts of nitrogen.
- **Canavalia** (_Canavalia ensiformis_): Jack bean — drought-tolerant, shade-tolerant.
- **Arachis pintoi**: Perennial peanut — excellent permanent living cover under trees.

### Grass Cover Crops

- **Brachiaria**: Controls erosion on slopes.
- **Vetiver**: Extreme erosion control on steep terrain.

## Benefits

- **Erosion control**: Living roots hold soil; canopy intercepts rain.
- **Nitrogen fixation**: Leguminous covers add 50–200 kg N/ha/year.
- **Weed suppression**: Dense cover outcompetes weeds for light and space.
- **Soil biology**: Promotes earthworms, mycorrhizae, and beneficial bacteria.
- **Moisture retention**: Living cover reduces evaporation.

## Costa Rican Applications

### Coffee Plantations

_Arachis pintoi_ (maní forrajero) is widely planted as permanent living cover between coffee rows — fixes nitrogen, controls erosion, and doubles as ornamental ground cover.

### Reforestation Sites

Cover crops are planted between newly established seedlings to control weeds and build soil while trees are small.

### Slope Agriculture

On steep hillsides in the Central Valley and Pacific slopes, cover crops combined with contour planting prevent catastrophic erosion during heavy rains.

## Why It Matters

- **Soil conservation**: Costa Rica's steep terrain and intense rainfall make cover crops essential for sustainable agriculture.
- **Reduced inputs**: Cover crops decrease or eliminate the need for synthetic fertilizers and herbicides.
- **Carbon sequestration**: Root biomass and organic matter additions store carbon in the soil.
