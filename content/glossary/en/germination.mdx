## What is Germination?

Germination is the awakening of a seed—the moment when a dormant embryo begins to grow after potentially months or years of waiting. It's the critical first step in a tree's life, when the seed absorbs water, swells, breaks open, and sends out its first root.

## The Germination Process

### Stage 1: Imbibition (Water Absorption)

**Rapid Water Uptake:**

- Dry seed absorbs water quickly
- Seed can swell 50-200% in volume
- Rehydrates dormant embryo
- Takes 6-48 hours depending on species

**Seed Coat Response:**

- Hard seed coats may need scarification first
- Soft coats split naturally from pressure
- Water enters through micropyle (tiny opening)
- Triggers metabolic reactivation

### Stage 2: Activation

**Metabolic Awakening:**

- Enzymes become active
- Stored food mobilizes (starches → sugars)
- Respiration increases dramatically
- Energy production begins
- Temperature critical at this stage

**No Visible Change Yet:**

- Seed looks the same externally
- Internal biochemistry ramping up
- Point of no return—seed committed to growth
- Failure here = seed death

### Stage 3: Radicle Emergence

**First Visible Sign:**

- Embryonic root (radicle) breaks through seed coat
- OFFICIAL GERMINATION MOMENT (botanically)
- Grows downward due to gravity (gravitropism)
- Begins absorbing water and nutrients
- Usually 2-14 days after imbibition

**Critical Period:**

- Seedling most vulnerable now
- Must maintain moisture
- Fungal infection risk high
- Predation by insects/birds

### Stage 4: Seedling Establishment

**Root Development:**

- Radicle develops into primary root
- Lateral roots begin forming
- Root hairs appear for absorption
- Anchors seedling in soil

**Shoot Emergence:**

- Cotyledons (seed leaves) push up
- OR remain below ground (hypogeal germination)
- True leaves develop
- Photosynthesis begins
- Seedling becomes self-sufficient

## Types of Germination

### Epigeal Germination (Above-Ground)

**Process:**

- Cotyledons emerge above soil
- Act as first photosynthetic organs
- Green and leaf-like
- Stay attached to seedling for weeks/months

**Characteristics:**

- Common in beans, squash, many tropical trees
- Provides quick energy from photosynthesis
- Vulnerable to herbivory
- Needs good light

**Costa Rican Examples:**

- **Pochote** (_Pachira quinata_): Large cotyledons emerge
- **Frijolillo** (many legumes): Classic bean-style germination
- **Balsa** (_Ochroma pyramidale_): Fast epigeal emergence

### Hypogeal Germination (Below-Ground)

**Process:**

- Cotyledons stay underground
- Remain inside or attached to seed
- Act as food storage organs
- First true leaves emerge directly

**Characteristics:**

- Common in oaks, peas, many grasses
- Protected cotyledons
- Slower initial growth
- Less vulnerable to surface hazards

**Costa Rican Examples:**

- **Roble** (_Quercus_ spp.): Acorns remain below
- **Mango** (_Mangifera indica_): Large seed stays buried
- **Almendro** (_Dipteryx panamensis_): Seed contains large energy reserve

## Environmental Requirements

### Water (Critical)

**Moisture Needs:**

- Seeds need consistent moisture for germination
- Too much water = oxygen deprivation, rotting
- Too little = desiccation, death
- Sweet spot varies by species

**Costa Rican Context:**

- **Rainy season planting** ideal (May-November)
- Dry season germination risky without irrigation
- Some species wait for rain to break dormancy
- Flash flood risk in heavy rains

### Temperature

**Optimal Ranges:**

- **Tropical lowland trees:** 25-35°C (77-95°F)
- **Highland species:** 15-25°C (59-77°F)
- **Temperate imports:** May need cool stratification first

**Too Hot:**

- Enzyme denaturation
- Embryo death
- Increased pathogen activity

**Too Cold:**

- Metabolic slowdown
- Germination delayed or prevented
- Rare problem in Costa Rican lowlands

### Oxygen

**Respiration Requirement:**

- Seeds need oxygen for cellular respiration
- Waterlogged soil = anaerobic conditions
- Well-drained soil essential
- Seed depth affects oxygen availability

**Depth Considerations:**

- **Small seeds** (Balsa, Melina): Surface or very shallow (1-5mm)
- **Medium seeds** (Pochote): 1-2 cm deep
- **Large seeds** (Almendro, Guanacaste): 3-5 cm deep
- **Too deep** = insufficient oxygen, weak emergence

### Light

**Variable Requirements:**

- **Light-requiring seeds** (photoblastic positive): Need light to germinate
- **Dark-requiring seeds** (photoblastic negative): Inhibited by light
- **Light-indifferent seeds**: Germinate either way

**Costa Rican Pioneer Species:**

- Many require light gaps
- Won't germinate in deep shade
- Triggered by canopy opening
- Examples: Balsa, Guarumo, Cecropia

## Seed Dormancy

### Why Seeds Don't Germinate Immediately

**Adaptive Strategy:**

- Prevents germination at wrong time
- Avoids dry season emergence
- Allows seed dispersal period
- Ensures genetic mixing

### Types of Dormancy

**Physical Dormancy:**

- Hard, impermeable seed coat
- Prevents water absorption
- Needs scarification (abrasion, fire, acid, weathering)
- Examples: Many legumes (Guanacaste, Cenízaro)

**Physiological Dormancy:**

- Internal biochemical blocks
- Requires after-ripening period
- May need cold/warm stratification
- Chemical inhibitors must break down

**Morphological Dormancy:**

- Embryo underdeveloped at seed fall
- Needs time to mature inside seed
- Common in some tropical species

**Combinational Dormancy:**

- Multiple factors combined
- Most difficult to break
- Requires specific sequence of conditions

## Breaking Dormancy (For Propagation)

### Scarification Methods

**Mechanical:**

- Sand paper rubbing
- Nicking with knife
- Filing
- Be careful not to damage embryo

**Hot Water Treatment:**

- Pour boiling water over seeds
- Let soak 12-24 hours as water cools
- Works for many legumes
- Simple and effective

**Acid Scarification:**

- Sulfuric acid treatment (concentrated)
- DANGEROUS—professional use only
- Mimics animal digestion
- Very effective for hard-coated seeds

**Natural:**

- Passage through animal digestive system
- Fire (some species)
- Weathering over time
- Bacterial/fungal action

### Stratification

**Cold Stratification:**

- Refrigerate moist seeds
- Mimics winter conditions
- Needed for temperate species
- Rarely needed in Costa Rica

**Warm Stratification:**

- Keep seeds warm and moist
- Allows after-ripening
- Breaks physiological dormancy
- Common for tropical species

### Pre-Soaking

**Simple Method:**

- Soak seeds in water 12-48 hours
- Softens seed coat
- Begins imbibition
- Reveals viable vs non-viable seeds (sinkers vs floaters)

## Germination Success Factors

### Seed Quality

**Viability Indicators:**

- **Fresh seeds**: Higher germination rates
- **Proper storage**: Cool, dry conditions
- **No damage**: Intact seed coat and embryo
- **Float test**: Viable seeds sink, dead ones float

**Seed Maturity:**

- Collected at right time
- Fully developed embryo
- Adequate food reserves
- Proper color/hardness for species

### Site Selection

**Microsite Quality:**

- Appropriate light level
- Good drainage
- Protected from wind
- Moderate temperature
- Absence of allelopathic plants

### Pest Protection

**Threats:**

- Insects eating seeds
- Fungi causing damping-off disease
- Rodents/agoutis digging up seeds
- Birds pecking seedlings
- Leaf-cutter ants

**Protection Methods:**

- Wire mesh covers
- Fungicide treatments (minimal)
- Companion planting
- Regular monitoring

## Costa Rican Germination Patterns

### Seasonal Timing

**Rainy Season Germinators:**

- **Reforestation**: Plan timing and methods
- **Species Identification**: Recognize seedlings early
- **Nursery Management**: Optimize germination rates
- **Conservation**: Collect and store seeds properly
- **Troubleshooting**: Diagnose why seeds aren't germinating

## Common Germination Problems

### Seeds Don't Germinate

**Possible Causes:**

- Dormancy not broken
- Old/non-viable seeds
- Too deep or shallow planting
- Wrong temperature
- Too wet or too dry
- Seed eaten by pests

### Seedlings Die After Emergence

**Damping-Off Disease:**

- Fungal infection at soil line
- Seedling stem rots and collapses
- Caused by overwatering, poor drainage
- Prevention: Good air circulation, fungicides

### Weak, Leggy Seedlings

**Insufficient Light:**

- Seedling stretches toward light
- Thin, pale stem
- Small, pale leaves
- Solution: Increase light gradually

## Field Recognition

**Germinating Seed Signs:**

- Cracked or split seed coat
- Root tip emerging
- Soil surface disturbed/lifted
- Cotyledons pushing through soil
- Fresh green color

**Timing to First Emergence:**

- Check species-specific information
- Generally 1-8 weeks for most trees
- Be patient—some take months
- Mark planted areas to track
