## What is a Watershed?

A **watershed** is nature's plumbing system - all the land area that collects rain and snowmelt, funneling it downhill through creeks, streams, and rivers to a common point like a bay, lake, or ocean.

## Key Concepts

**Boundaries**: Ridge tops and high points define watershed edges
**Nested**: Small watersheds drain into larger ones
**Interconnected**: Everything upstream affects downstream
**Scale**: From tiny (few acres) to massive (Amazon basin)

## Costa Rican Watersheds

**Major basins:**

- Pacific slope (shorter, steeper rivers)
- Caribbean slope (longer, gentler rivers)
- Central Valley (internal drainage)

**Important watersheds:**

- Tempisque (Guanacaste)
- Reventazón-Parismina (Caribbean)
- Grande de Térraba (largest Pacific)
- Sarapiquí (Caribbean lowlands)

## Why Watersheds Matter

**Water quality**: Pollution anywhere affects entire system
**Flood control**: Upstream deforestation increases downstream flooding
**Biodiversity**: Riparian corridors connect habitats
**Human use**: Drinking water, irrigation, hydropower
**Planning unit**: Natural boundary for resource management

## Threats

- Deforestation removes natural water filtration
- Agriculture adds sediment and chemicals
- Urban development increases runoff
- Dam construction alters flow patterns
- Climate change shifts precipitation

## Conservation

**Watershed management:**

- Protect forests, especially on steep slopes and riverbanks
- Riparian buffer zones (10-50m minimum)
- Payment for Ecosystem Services (PSA) in Costa Rica
- Integrated land-use planning
- Community-based monitoring

**Best practices:**

- Maintain forest cover ≥40% of watershed
- Protect headwaters and springs
- Restore degraded riparian zones
- Reduce erosion with cover crops
- Treat wastewater before discharge
