## What is Intercropping?

Intercropping is the practice of growing multiple crop species together in the same field at the same time. When trees are one of the components, intercropping becomes a form of agroforestry. The goal is to use resources (light, water, nutrients) more efficiently than any single crop could alone.

## Types

### Row Intercropping

Crops arranged in alternating rows — e.g., maize rows between rows of beans.

### Relay Intercropping

A second crop is planted before the first crop is harvested — overlapping growth periods.

### Mixed Intercropping

Multiple species planted together without distinct rows — traditional milpa gardens.

### Strip Intercropping

Wide strips of different crops alternate across the field.

## Benefits

- **Yield advantage**: Total production per hectare often exceeds monoculture (Land Equivalent Ratio > 1.0).
- **Pest reduction**: Species diversity confuses pests and attracts natural enemies.
- **Risk management**: If one crop fails, others may still produce.
- **Soil health**: Deeper and shallower root systems access different soil layers.

## Costa Rican Examples

### Milpa System

Traditional maize + beans + squash — the "Three Sisters" adapted to Central American conditions. Beans fix nitrogen, maize provides climbing structure, squash shades soil.

### Cacao + Banana + Timber

Caribbean lowland farmers interplant young cacao with bananas (temporary shade and early income) and timber trees (long-term shade and investment).

## Why It Matters

- **Food security**: Diverse crops buffer against climate variability.
- **Cultural heritage**: Intercropping systems like milpa are millennia-old indigenous innovations.
- **Sustainability**: Reduces dependence on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides.
