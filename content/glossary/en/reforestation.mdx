## What is Reforestation?

Reforestation is the intentional planting of trees to restore forest cover on deforested land. Costa Rica is a global leader in reforestation, having reversed decades of deforestation.

## Costa Rica's Reforestation Success

### Historical Context

- **1940s-1980s**: Forest cover declined from 75% to 21%
- **1996**: Payment for Environmental Services (PSA) program launched
- **Today**: Forest cover recovered to ~60% of territory
- **Result**: One of the few countries to reverse deforestation

## Types of Reforestation

### Native Species Reforestation

**Goal**: Restore natural ecosystems and biodiversity

**Costa Rican Natives Used:**

- **Guanacaste** (_Enterolobium cyclocarpum_): Nitrogen-fixing canopy tree
- **Pochote** (_Pachira quinata_): Fast-growing native
- **Roble Sabana** (_Tabebuia rosea_): Beautiful flowering tree
- **Espavel** (_Anacardium excelsum_): Wildlife food source

**Advantages:**

- Supports native wildlife
- Requires no irrigation once established
- Resistant to local pests/diseases
- Permanent ecological restoration

### Timber Plantation Reforestation

**Goal**: Produce commercial timber while providing environmental services

**Common Plantation Species:**

- **Melina** (_Gmelina arborea_): Fast-growing (harvest 8-10 years)
- **Teca/Teak** (_Tectona grandis_): Premium hardwood (20-25 years)
- **Pochote** (_Bombacopsis quinata_): Valuable native timber

**Advantages:**

- Economic returns for landowners
- Reduces pressure on natural forests
- Provides ecosystem services during growth
- Can transition to natural forest if left unharvested

### Mixed Reforestation

**Goal**: Balance ecology and economics

Combines fast-growing timber species with slower-growing natives. Timber harvest provides income while native species gradually dominate.

## Reforestation Methods

### Direct Seeding

- Scatter or plant seeds directly in soil
- Low cost but lower success rate
- Best for pioneer species in good conditions

### Seedling Planting

- Grow seedlings in nursery 6-12 months
- Plant during rainy season (May-November)
- Higher success rate, more expensive
- Standard method in Costa Rica

### Assisted Natural Regeneration

- Protect existing natural regeneration
- Remove competing vegetation
- Allow forest to regrow naturally
- Lowest cost, works on recently cleared land

## Challenges

### Ecological

- **Site degradation**: Compacted soil, erosion
- **Invasive grasses**: Compete with tree seedlings
- **Climate change**: Altered rainfall patterns
- **Wildlife pressure**: Cattle, deer browse seedlings

### Economic

- **High initial costs**: $1,000-3,000 per hectare
- **Long return period**: 8-25 years until harvest
- **Maintenance required**: 3-5 years of weeding, protection
- **Market risks**: Timber price fluctuations

### Social

- **Land tenure**: Unclear ownership prevents investment
- **Cultural shifts**: From ranching to forestry mindset
- **Technical knowledge**: Training needed in silviculture

## Why It Matters

Reforestation provides critical benefits:

- **Climate**: Carbon sequestration, cooling
- **Water**: Watershed protection, aquifer recharge
- **Biodiversity**: Habitat for endangered species
- **Economy**: Timber, ecotourism, ecosystem payments
- **Soil**: Erosion control, fertility restoration
- **Social**: Employment, cultural heritage preservation

## Costa Rican Programs

### PSA (Payment for Environmental Services)

Government pays landowners for forest conservation and reforestation. Approximately $60-120/hectare/year.

### FONAFIFO

National Forestry Financing Fund administers PSA program and provides technical assistance.

### NGO Partnerships

Organizations like Rainforest Alliance, Conservation International support community reforestation projects.
