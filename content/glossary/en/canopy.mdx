## What is the Canopy?

The forest canopy is the highest layer of vegetation in a forest, typically 25-45 meters (80-150 feet) above the ground in tropical forests. It acts as a roof over the forest, capturing most of the sunlight and creating a unique habitat.

### Canopy Characteristics

**Light Interception**

- Captures 60-90% of incoming sunlight
- Creates shaded conditions below
- Drives photosynthesis for the entire forest

**Biodiversity Hotspot**

- Home to more than half of all rainforest species
- Unique microclimate with higher temperatures
- Lower humidity than forest floor

**Physical Structure**

- Continuous or broken coverage
- Varies in height and density
- Changes with seasons (deciduous vs evergreen)

## Forest Layers

The canopy is one of several vertical layers:

1. **Emergent Layer**: Tallest trees breaking through canopy (40-80m)
2. **Canopy Layer**: Main tree crowns (25-45m) ← You are here
3. **Understory**: Smaller trees and saplings (5-25m)
4. **Shrub Layer**: Bushes and small plants (0-5m)
5. **Forest Floor**: Ground level vegetation

## Ecological Importance

**Climate Regulation**

- Regulates temperature and humidity
- Influences rainfall patterns
- Stores massive amounts of carbon

**Wildlife Habitat**

- Primary habitat for monkeys, sloths, birds
- Fruit and flower resources for pollinators
- Arboreal pathways for animal movement

## Canopy Trees in Costa Rica

Many iconic Costa Rican trees form the canopy:

- **Ceiba** (_Ceiba pentandra_): Emergent/canopy species reaching 60m
- **Guanacaste** (_Enterolobium cyclocarpum_): Broad canopy spreader
- **Almendro** (_Dipteryx panamensis_): Dense canopy former in Caribbean forests
