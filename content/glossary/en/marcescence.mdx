## What is Marcescence?

Marcescence is when a tree holds onto its dead leaves instead of dropping them. The leaves wither and turn brown but remain stubbornly attached to the branches, sometimes all through the dry season until new growth pushes them off.

## How It Differs from Normal Leaf Fall

### Normal Deciduous Process

1. Tree forms an abscission zone (separation layer) at the leaf base.
2. Abscission zone completes — leaf detaches cleanly.
3. Scar seals over to prevent water loss and infection.

### Marcescent Process

1. Tree forms a partial abscission zone.
2. Zone does not fully complete — leaf dies but stays attached.
3. Dead leaf may persist for months until new buds mechanically push it off.

## Why Do Trees Hold Dead Leaves?

Several hypotheses exist:

- **Herbivore deterrence**: Dry, unpalatable leaves may deter browsers from eating new buds.
- **Moisture trap**: Dead leaves catch snow or dew, delivering water to the base.
- **Delayed mulch**: Leaves drop in spring when nutrients from decomposition are most needed.
- **Development constraint**: Young trees are more marcescent — it may be a juvenile trait.

## Costa Rican Examples

### Roble Encino (_Quercus_ spp.)

Highland oaks in Costa Rica commonly display marcescence, with brown leaves persisting through the dry months on lower and inner branches while upper branches may be bare.

## Why It Matters

- **Identification**: Marcescence is a useful identification feature — few tropical trees display this behavior.
- **Ecology**: Marcescent leaves may affect litter timing and decomposition patterns.
- **Aesthetics**: The persistence of brown leaves gives marcescent oaks a distinctive winter/dry-season appearance.
