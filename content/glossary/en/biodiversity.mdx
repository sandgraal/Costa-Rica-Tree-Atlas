## What is Biodiversity?

Biodiversity means "the variety of life" - all the different kinds of plants, animals, fungi, and microorganisms living together in a place. It includes not just how many species exist, but also their genetic variety and the different ecosystems they create.

## Three Levels of Biodiversity

### 1. Genetic Diversity

**Within a single species:**

- Different genes in population
- Variation in traits
- Adaptation potential
- Disease resistance

**Example**: All Guanacaste trees are one species, but individuals vary in:

- Leaf size and shape
- Flowering time
- Drought tolerance
- Growth rate

### 2. Species Diversity

**Different species in a community:**

- Number of species (richness)
- Relative abundance (evenness)
- Functional roles
- Trophic levels

**Example**: Costa Rican rainforest might have:

- 100+ tree species per hectare
- Thousands of insect species
- Hundreds of bird species
- Complex food webs

### 3. Ecosystem Diversity

**Different habitats in a landscape:**

- Rainforest, cloud forest, dry forest
- Rivers, wetlands, mangroves
- Mountains, valleys, coasts
- Different successional stages

## Why Biodiversity Matters

### Ecosystem Services

**Provisioning:**

- Food, medicine, timber
- Fresh water
- Genetic resources

**Regulating:**

- Climate regulation
- Flood control
- Disease control
- Pollination

**Supporting:**

- Soil formation
- Nutrient cycling
- Primary production

**Cultural:**

- Recreation
- Education
- Spiritual values
- Aesthetic beauty

## Costa Rica: A Biodiversity Hotspot

### Remarkable Statistics

- **0.03%** of Earth's surface
- **5%** of world's biodiversity
- **500,000+** species estimated
- **25%** land protected

### Why So Diverse?

**Geographic factors:**

- Bridge between continents
- Pacific and Caribbean coasts
- Mountain ranges (0-3800m elevation)
- 12+ life zones

**Climate factors:**

- Tropical location
- Year-round warmth
- Varied rainfall patterns
- Seasonal transitions

## Measuring Biodiversity

### Species Richness

Simply counting species:

- Most basic measure
- Easy to understand
- Doesn't account for abundance

### Shannon Index

Accounts for both richness and evenness:

- Higher value = more diverse
- Considers rare and common species
- Used in scientific studies

### Functional Diversity

Different roles species play:

- Nitrogen fixers (legumes)
- Pollinators (hummingbirds, bees)
- Seed dispersers (bats, birds)
- Decomposers (fungi, bacteria)

## Threats to Biodiversity

### Major Causes of Loss

1. **Habitat destruction**: Deforestation, agriculture
2. **Climate change**: Altered rainfall, temperatures
3. **Pollution**: Pesticides, plastics, chemicals
4. **Invasive species**: Outcompete natives
5. **Overexploitation**: Hunting, logging, collection

### In Costa Rica

**Historical loss:**

- 1940s: 75% forest cover
- 1987: 21% forest cover (minimum)
- 2020: 54% forest cover (recovering!)

**Success factors:**

- Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES)
- National park system
- Ecotourism economy
- Reforestation programs

## Tree Biodiversity

### Why Trees Are Key

**Forest structure creators:**

- Canopy provides habitat
- Roots stabilize soil
- Trunks create vertical habitat
- Dead wood feeds decomposers

**Support networks:**

- One tree species supports hundreds of insects
- Insects feed birds and bats
- Fruits feed mammals
- Flowers feed pollinators

### Costa Rican Tree Diversity

**Approximately 3,000+ tree species**:

- More than all of North America
- Concentrated in small country
- Many endemic (found nowhere else)
- Wide variety of families

## Conservation Strategies

### Protected Areas

**National Parks:**

- 27 national parks
- Protect representative ecosystems
- Tourism revenue funds conservation

**Biological Corridors:**

- Connect isolated fragments
- Allow animal movement
- Genetic exchange between populations

### Sustainable Use

**Agroforestry:**

- Trees + crops
- Maintains some biodiversity
- Shade-grown coffee, cacao

**Selective logging:**

- Less impact than clear-cutting
- Allows forest regeneration
- Provides income

## How Trees Increase Biodiversity

**Single tree supports:**

- Epiphytes (orchids, bromeliads)
- Lichens and mosses
- Nesting birds
- Fruit-eating mammals
- Pollinating insects
- Decomposer communities

**Example**: One Guanacaste tree can host:

- 50+ epiphyte species
- 100+ insect species
- 20+ bird species
- Multiple mammal species

## Why It Matters

Understanding biodiversity helps with:

- **Conservation priorities**: Protect biodiversity hotspots
- **Ecosystem management**: Maintain functional diversity
- **Restoration**: Choose diverse native species
- **Climate resilience**: Diverse ecosystems adapt better
- **Human wellbeing**: Biodiversity provides services we depend on

## Field Recognition

**Signs of high biodiversity:**

- Many different tree species
- Varied canopy structure
- Abundant epiphytes
- Diverse bird calls
- Healthy understory
- Evidence of wildlife
- Complex forest structure

## Take Action

**Support biodiversity:**

1. Plant native tree species
2. Avoid invasive plants
3. Support local conservation
4. Choose sustainable products
5. Visit and fund protected areas
6. Reduce, reuse, recycle
7. Learn and share knowledge
