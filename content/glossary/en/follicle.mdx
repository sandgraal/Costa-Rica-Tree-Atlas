## What is a Follicle?

A follicle is a dry fruit that opens along one seam to release its seeds. Unlike a capsule (which splits along multiple lines) or a legume (which splits along two sides), a follicle opens along just one side.

## Structure

### Key Features

1. **Single carpel origin**: Develops from one simple pistil
2. **One-sided opening**: Splits along ventral (belly) suture only
3. **Multiple seeds**: Usually contains several to many seeds
4. **Dry at maturity**: Not fleshy like drupes or berries

## Common Examples

**Temperate Plants:**

- Milkweed (Asclepias)
- Larkspur, columbine (Ranunculaceae family)
- Magnolia (when aggregate, multiple follicles per flower)

**Tropical Examples:**

- Magnolia species
- Sterculia species (Panama tree)

## Costa Rican Tree Follicles

### Magnolia (_Magnolia poasana_)

The endangered Costa Rican magnolia produces an aggregate fruit of multiple follicles arranged spirally. Each follicle opens to reveal bright red seeds.

### Panamá (_Sterculia apetala_)

Produces large woody follicles 10-15 cm long that split open like a boat, revealing black seeds with edible arils. The opened pods persist on the tree.

## Seed Dispersal

Follicles have evolved various dispersal mechanisms:

- **Wind**: Light seeds with papery wings or silky hairs (milkweed)
- **Gravity**: Heavy seeds simply fall when pod opens
- **Animals**: Bright seed coats (red, orange) attract birds

## Why It Matters

Understanding follicles helps with:

- **Seed collection**: Know when pods will open naturally
- **Propagation**: Timing seed harvest before dispersal
- **Identification**: Follicles are diagnostic for certain families
- **Evolution**: Shows relationship between plant families
