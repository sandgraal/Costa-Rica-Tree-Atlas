simpleDefinition: "A phenomenon where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent tree, producing a seedling that drops ready to root."
technicalDefinition: "Premature germination of seeds on the parent plant prior to dispersal, either crypto-viviparous (germination within the fruit) or true viviparous (seedling emerges from the fruit and grows while still attached), most notably in mangrove species."

## What is Vivipary?

Vivipary in plants occurs when seeds germinate while still attached to the parent tree, producing a seedling (propagule) that eventually drops and establishes immediately — skipping the normal seed dormancy stage. This remarkable adaptation is most famously associated with mangrove trees.

## How It Works in Mangroves

1. **Seed develops** within the fruit on the parent tree.
2. **Germination begins**: The seed germinates in place; a root (radicle) and hypocotyl grow.
3. **Propagule grows**: The elongating structure can reach 20–40 cm while still attached.
4. **Release**: The mature propagule drops from the parent.
5. **Establishment**: The propagule floats, drifts with tides, and roots when it contacts suitable substrate.

## Types

### True Vivipary

Seed breaks through the fruit coat and produces a visible propagule on the parent:

- **Mangle Rojo** (_Rhizophora mangle_): Classic example — pencil-like propagules hang from the parent for months.

### Crypto-Vivipary

Seed germinates within the fruit but does not visibly emerge before dispersal:

- **Mangle Negro** (_Avicennia germinans_): Seeds germinate inside the fruit before it drops.

## Why Mangroves Use Vivipary

- **Tidal environment**: Ready-to-root propagules can establish quickly before being washed away.
- **Saltwater tolerance**: Propagules are pre-adapted to saline conditions.
- **No dormancy needed**: The continuously warm, wet tropical environment makes dormancy unnecessary.
- **Buoyancy**: Propagules float, enabling dispersal by ocean currents.

## Costa Rican Examples

### Mangle Rojo (_Rhizophora mangle_)

The textbook viviparous species — found in Golfo Dulce, Nicoya Gulf, and both Pacific and Caribbean estuaries. Propagules can float for up to a year, dispersing along the coast.

### Mangle Blanco (_Laguncularia racemosa_)

Shows crypto-vivipary — seeds begin germinating inside the fruit before drop.

## Why It Matters

- **Mangrove conservation**: Understanding vivipary is essential for mangrove restoration nursery techniques.
- **Coastal protection**: Viviparous propagule dispersal naturally repairs damaged mangrove coastlines.
- **Climate adaptation**: Mangrove range expansion through viviparous dispersal is a natural climate adaptation mechanism.
