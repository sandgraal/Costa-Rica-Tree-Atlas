## What is Entomophily?

Entomophily is insect pollination — the most common pollination strategy in tropical trees. Flowers attract insect visitors with colors, scents, and nectar rewards; in return, the insects carry pollen from flower to flower, enabling cross-fertilization.

## Major Insect Pollinators

### Bees

- The dominant pollinators of tropical trees.
- Attracted by yellow, blue, and ultraviolet-reflecting flowers.
- Collect both pollen (protein) and nectar (energy).
- In Costa Rica: stingless bees (Meliponini), carpenter bees, orchid bees.

### Butterflies

- Attracted by bright red, orange, and pink flowers.
- Long proboscis reaches deep tubular flowers.
- Day-flying — visit flowers in direct sunlight.

### Moths

- Attracted by white or pale, fragrant night-blooming flowers.
- Long proboscis for tubular flowers.
- Important nocturnal pollinators in tropical forests.

### Beetles

- Attracted by dull-colored, strongly scented flowers.
- Ancient pollination relationship — beetles were early pollinators.
- Often damage flowers while feeding (mess-and-soil pollination).

### Flies

- Attracted by dark-colored, foul-smelling flowers (mimicking rotting material).
- Important pollinators for some tropical trees including cacao.

## Flower Adaptations

- **Color**: Targeted at specific insect visual systems.
- **Scent**: Chemical attractants matched to pollinator preferences.
- **Nectar**: Sugar reward calibrated to pollinator energy needs.
- **Landing platforms**: Petal shapes that accommodate insect visitors.
- **Guides**: UV patterns (invisible to humans) that direct insects to pollen/nectar.

## Costa Rican Examples

### Cacao (_Theobroma cacao_)

Pollinated by tiny midges (Ceratopogonidae) — the flowers are so small that only these 1–3 mm insects can access them.

### Corteza Amarilla (_Handroanthus ochraceus_)

Mass flowering attracts large carpenter bees and stingless bees that ensure cross-pollination during the brief bloom period.

## Why It Matters

- **Food production**: Most tropical fruit trees depend on insect pollination.
- **Conservation**: Pollinator decline threatens food security and forest reproduction.
- **Ecosystem services**: Insect pollination is valued at billions of dollars globally.
