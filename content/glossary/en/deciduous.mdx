## Understanding Deciduous Trees

Deciduous trees are nature's way of surviving difficult conditions. By dropping their leaves, trees conserve water and energy during challenging times, then rebound vigorously when conditions improve.

## In Tropical Costa Rica

Unlike temperate regions where trees lose leaves in winter cold, Costa Rican deciduous trees shed foliage during the **dry season** (December-April).

### Why Drop Leaves?

- **Water conservation**: Leaves lose massive amounts of water through transpiration
- **Drought survival**: Reducing surface area prevents dehydration
- **Nutrient recycling**: Fallen leaves enrich soil
- **Energy efficiency**: No point keeping leaves when water is limited

## The Deciduous Cycle

### Dry Season (Dec-April)

1. **Senescence**: Chlorophyll breaks down, revealing yellow/orange pigments
2. **Abscission**: Special cells form at leaf base, cutting off water/nutrients
3. **Leaf drop**: Leaves fall, often spectacularly all at once
4. **Dormancy**: Tree conserves resources, appears "dead"

### Rainy Season (May-Nov)

5. **Bud break**: New leaves emerge rapidly with first rains
6. **Leaf expansion**: Full canopy develops within days/weeks
7. **Peak growth**: Tree maximizes photosynthesis and growth

## Benefits of Going Deciduous

**For the Tree:**

- Survive extended drought
- Concentrate flowering energy (many bloom while leafless)
- Shed parasites and pests with old leaves

**For the Ecosystem:**

- Nutrient pulse from decomposing leaves
- Light reaches forest floor during leaf-off period
- Synchronized flowering creates pollinator abundance

## Spectacular Examples

### Guanacaste (_Enterolobium cyclocarpum_)

Costa Rica's national tree is dramatically deciduous, creating a bare sculptural silhouette in dry season, then erupting in bright green foliage with the rains.

### Corteza Amarilla (_Tabebuia chrysantha_)

Loses leaves then explodes in golden-yellow flowers, one of the most spectacular sights in Costa Rican dry forests.

### Roble Sabana (_Tabebuia rosea_)

Drops leaves and immediately produces masses of pink-purple flowers.

## Identification Tip

Look for:

- Bare branches during dry season (Dec-April)
- Synchronized leaf flush with first rains
- Often spectacular flowering while leafless
- Dense canopy during rainy season
