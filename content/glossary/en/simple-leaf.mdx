## Visual Description

A simple leaf has a **single, undivided blade** (lamina) attached to the twig by a petiole (leaf stalk). The blade may have various shapes and edge types, but it remains one continuous piece.

### Key Characteristics

- **Single blade**: Not divided into separate leaflets
- **Axillary bud**: Present where petiole meets stem
- **Continuous margin**: Even if lobed, the blade is continuous

### Leaf Shapes

Simple leaves come in many shapes:

**Common Shapes:**

- **Ovate**: Egg-shaped, broader at base
- **Lanceolate**: Lance-shaped, long and narrow
- **Cordate**: Heart-shaped
- **Orbicular**: Circular or nearly round
- **Elliptic**: Oval with equal ends

**Lobed vs. Unlobed:**

- Some simple leaves have deep indentations (lobes) but remain one piece
- Oak leaves are simple despite their lobes
- The key is continuity of the blade tissue

## How to Distinguish from Compound Leaves

**The Bud Test** is most reliable:

- Simple leaves have ONE bud at the base
- Compound leaves have ONE bud for all leaflets
- Individual leaflets have NO buds

**The Drop Test:**

- Simple leaves fall individually
- Compound leaves fall as one unit (all leaflets together)

## Why It Matters

Simple leaves are:

- **Easier to identify**: More consistent shape
- **Common identification feature**: Many field guides start with leaf type
- **Evolutionary advantage**: Simpler structure, less energy to build
- **Drought tolerance**: Often have thicker, more protected blades

## Margin Types

Simple leaves display various edge types:

- **Entire**: Smooth edge (e.g., Magnolia)
- **Serrate**: Saw-toothed edge
- **Dentate**: Tooth-like projections
- **Lobed**: Deep indentations
- **Undulate**: Wavy edge

## Examples in Costa Rica

**Unlobed Simple Leaves:**

- Guayabo (_Psidium guajava_): Ovate, entire margin
- Mango (_Mangifera indica_): Lanceolate
- Laurel (_Cordia alliodora_): Ovate with serrate margin

**Lobed Simple Leaves:**

- Papaya (_Carica papaya_): Deeply lobed but still simple
- Cecropia (_Cecropia peltata_): Palmate lobes
