## What is a Trichome?

Trichomes are the hairs, prickles, scales, and glandular structures found on plant surfaces. They range from invisible fuzz to prominent bristles and serve a surprising variety of functions — from deterring herbivores to trapping moisture.

## Types

### Non-Glandular (Structural)

- **Simple hairs**: Single-celled or multicellular straight hairs.
- **Stellate (star-shaped)**: Multiple branches radiating from a base — common in tropical trees.
- **Peltate (shield-shaped)**: Flat, disc-like scales — found on Bromeliaceae.
- **Dendritic (tree-shaped)**: Branching like a miniature tree.

### Glandular (Secretory)

- **Capitate**: Stalked with a secretory head — produces oils, nectar, or defensive compounds.
- **Stinging hairs**: Hollow hairs filled with irritating chemicals (e.g., _Urtica_).

## Functions

- **Herbivore defense**: Dense trichomes deter insect feeding.
- **Water retention**: Trap moisture from fog and dew.
- **UV protection**: Shield leaf cells from intense tropical sun.
- **Temperature regulation**: Create an insulating air layer on the leaf surface.
- **Chemical warfare**: Glandular trichomes secrete toxic or repellent compounds.

## Costa Rican Examples

### Balsa (_Ochroma pyramidale_)

Young leaves are covered in stellate trichomes that give them a fuzzy, silvery appearance.

### Ceiba (_Ceiba pentandra_)

Seed-bearing capsules contain silky trichome-like fibers (kapok) used for stuffing and insulation.

## Why It Matters

- **Identification**: Trichome type, density, and distribution are key diagnostic features for species identification.
- **Ecology**: Trichome defenses shape plant-herbivore interactions.
- **Applied science**: Understanding trichome chemistry has applications in natural pesticide development.
