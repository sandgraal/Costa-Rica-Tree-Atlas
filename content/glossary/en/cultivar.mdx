## What is a Cultivar?

A cultivar is a plant that has been deliberately selected or bred for particular traits — sweeter fruit, brighter flowers, disease resistance, faster growth, or any other characteristic valued by humans. Cultivar names are written in single quotes after the species name: _Mangifera indica_ 'Tommy Atkins'.

## How Cultivars Are Created

1. **Selection**: A naturally occurring variant is identified and propagated.
2. **Breeding**: Controlled crosses between plants produce offspring with desired traits.
3. **Mutation breeding**: Induced or natural mutations are stabilized through propagation.
4. **Clonal propagation**: Grafting, budding, or cuttings ensure genetic uniformity.

## Naming Rules

- Written in Roman type (not italic) with single quotes: 'Hass', 'Kent'.
- Cannot be in Latin form (to distinguish from botanical varieties).
- Registered with the International Cultivar Registration Authority (ICRA).

## Costa Rican Cultivars

### Mango (_Mangifera indica_)

- 'Tommy Atkins': Most commercially planted — good shipping qualities.
- 'Keith': Large fruit, rich flavor — popular in Costa Rica.
- 'Mora': Local selection adapted to lowland Pacific conditions.

### Aguacate/Avocado (_Persea americana_)

- 'Hass': The dominant global cultivar, grown in Costa Rica's Central Valley.
- 'Choquette': Large Florida-type avocado for Caribbean lowlands.

### Cacao (_Theobroma cacao_)

- 'CCN-51': High-yield cultivar widely planted but controversial for flavor.
- 'Criollo': Traditional fine-flavor cultivar still grown in Talamanca.

## Why It Matters

- **Agriculture**: Nearly all commercial fruit, timber, and ornamental trees are cultivars.
- **Genetic diversity**: Over-reliance on few cultivars creates vulnerability to disease.
- **Conservation**: Wild relatives of cultivated species are essential genetic resources for future breeding.
