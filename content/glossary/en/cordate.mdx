## What is Cordate?

Cordate describes a heart-shaped leaf with a distinctive notch at the base where the leaf attaches to the petiole. This is one of the most recognizable leaf shapes in nature.

## Identifying Cordate Leaves

### Key Features

1. **Rounded blade**: Overall heart or valentine shape
2. **Deep basal notch**: Indentation where petiole attaches
3. **Two basal lobes**: Rounded lobes on either side of notch
4. **Pointed apex**: Usually comes to a point at the tip

## Variations

### Related Heart Shapes

- **Broadly cordate**: Very wide, almost circular with small notch
- **Narrowly cordate**: Elongated heart shape
- **Obliquely cordate**: Asymmetrical, one lobe larger than the other

## Costa Rican Trees with Cordate Leaves

### Higuerón (_Ficus insipida_)

Large cordate leaves 15-25 cm long with prominent basal lobes. The heart shape is especially visible in young leaves.

### Guarumo (_Cecropia_ spp.)

Palmate leaves with individual lobes that are cordate-based. The leaf attachment shows the characteristic heart-shaped indentation.

### Passion Fruit Vines

Many _Passiflora_ species climbing on Costa Rican trees have distinctly cordate leaves, making them easy to identify.

## Why It Matters

Cordate leaves are important for:

- **Quick identification**: Heart-shape is instantly recognizable
- **Water shedding**: The pointed apex acts as a drip tip
- **Light capture**: Broad blade maximizes photosynthesis
- **Family indicators**: Common in certain plant families
