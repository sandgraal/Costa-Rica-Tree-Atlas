## What is Agroforestry?

Agroforestry is the deliberate integration of trees into farming systems. Rather than keeping forestry and agriculture separate, agroforestry combines them to produce mutual benefits — trees improve crop conditions while crops complement tree growth.

## Main Systems

### Agrisilviculture (Trees + Crops)

- **Alley cropping**: Crops grown between tree hedgerows.
- **Shade systems**: Crops under managed tree canopy (shade-grown coffee/cacao).
- **Taungya**: Crops grown among young plantation trees until canopy closes.

### Silvopasture (Trees + Livestock)

- **Scattered trees in pasture**: Traditional Guanacaste landscape.
- **Intensive silvopasture**: Dense shrub rows with grazing between them.

### Agrosilvopastoral (Trees + Crops + Livestock)

- Integrated systems with all components — common in smallholder farms.

### Tree Components in Farming

- **Living fences**: Fence posts that grow and produce.
- **Windbreaks**: Tree rows protecting crops and animals.
- **Riparian buffers**: Trees along waterways in farm landscapes.

## Costa Rica's Agroforestry Heritage

Costa Rica is a global leader in agroforestry:

- **Traditional systems**: Indigenous peoples have practiced agroforestry for millennia.
- **Coffee + shade trees**: Central Valley coffee farms are textbook agroforestry.
- **Cacao + timber**: Caribbean lowland system dating to pre-Columbian times.
- **PES program**: Pays farmers for agroforestry services (carbon, water, biodiversity).
- **CATIE**: World-renowned tropical agroforestry research center based in Turrialba.

## Benefits

- **Climate**: Carbon sequestration, microclimate improvement.
- **Biodiversity**: Tree components provide habitat and biological corridors.
- **Economics**: Diversified income reduces financial risk.
- **Soil**: Improved fertility, structure, and erosion control.
- **Water**: Better infiltration, reduced runoff, cleaner waterways.
