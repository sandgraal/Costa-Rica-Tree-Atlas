## What is a Living Fence?

A living fence is a fence built from living trees — typically large cuttings or stakes pushed into the ground, which sprout and grow into a permanent, self-renewing barrier. Barbed wire or fencing wire may be stapled to the living posts. Living fences are ubiquitous in the Costa Rican countryside.

## How They're Built

1. **Stake selection**: Cut branches 1.5–2.5 m long and 5–15 cm diameter from species that root easily from cuttings.
2. **Planting**: Push stakes into the ground at 1–3 m intervals during the wet season.
3. **Wire attachment**: Staple or tie barbed wire or smooth wire to the growing posts.
4. **Maintenance**: Periodic pruning controls height and produces firewood or mulch.

## Common Species in Costa Rica

### Top Choices

- **Madero Negro** (_Gliricidia sepium_): The most common — roots easily, fixes nitrogen, tolerant of repeated pruning.
- **Jocote** (_Spondias purpurea_): Produces edible fruit; very easy to establish from large cuttings.
- **Indio Desnudo** (_Bursera simaruba_): Distinctive red peeling bark; roots reliably.
- **Pochote** (_Pachira quinata_): Spiny trunk deters livestock from pushing through.

## Benefits

- **Self-renewing**: No post replacement needed — the fence repairs itself.
- **Multi-product**: Provides fodder, firewood, fruit, shade, and wildlife habitat.
- **Cost-effective**: After establishment, maintenance costs are minimal compared to dead-post fencing.
- **Connectivity**: Living fences serve as biological corridors, connecting forest fragments across agricultural landscapes.

## Costa Rican Context

An estimated 40% of Costa Rica's farm boundaries are living fences. They form the backbone of the country's biological corridor network, allowing wildlife to move between protected areas through the agricultural matrix.

## Why It Matters

- **Conservation**: Living fences support 50–80% of the bird species found in adjacent forests.
- **Climate**: Carbon sequestration in living fence trees is a recognized contribution to Costa Rica's carbon neutrality goals.
- **Rural economy**: Reduced fencing costs and multiple co-products benefit smallholder farmers.
