## What is Binomial Nomenclature?

Binomial nomenclature is the universal system for naming living organisms. Every species gets a unique two-part Latin name: the genus (a group of related species) followed by the specific epithet (identifying the particular species within that genus). For example, the Guanacaste tree is _Enterolobium cyclocarpum_.

## How It Works

### The Two Parts

1. **Genus**: Capitalized — groups closely related species (e.g., _Cedrela_).
2. **Specific epithet**: Lowercase — identifies the particular species (e.g., _odorata_).

### Complete Citation

A full scientific name includes the authority — the scientist who first described the species:

- _Cedrela odorata_ L. (Linnaeus described it)
- _Dipteryx panamensis_ (Pittier) Record & Mell

### Formatting Rules

- Always italicized (or underlined in handwriting).
- Genus may be abbreviated after first use: _C. odorata_.
- Authority not italicized.

## Why Not Just Use Common Names?

Common names are ambiguous:

- "Cedro" can refer to completely different trees in different countries.
- One tree may have dozens of common names across regions.
- Scientific names are universal — they work in any language.

## Costa Rican Examples

| Common Name      | Scientific Name            | Meaning                 |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Guanacaste       | _Enterolobium cyclocarpum_ | Round-fruited intestine |
| Corteza Amarilla | _Handroanthus ochraceus_   | Yellow Handroanthus     |
| Cocobolo         | _Dalbergia retusa_         | Notched Dalbergia       |

## Why It Matters

- **Precision**: Eliminates confusion caused by regional common names.
- **Research**: Enables scientists worldwide to communicate about the same organism.
- **Conservation**: CITES protections and IUCN listings are based on scientific names.
