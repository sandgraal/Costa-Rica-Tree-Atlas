## What is Old-Growth Forest?

Old-growth forest is ancient woodland that has never been cut down or seriously disturbed. These forests have huge old trees, multiple canopy layers, standing dead trees, fallen logs, and incredible biodiversity. They've been growing for hundreds of years without major human interference.

## Characteristics

### Defining Features

**Old trees:**

- 200-800+ years old
- Very large diameter (2-4+ meters)
- Massive crowns
- Fire scars, lightning damage

**Complex structure:**

- Multiple canopy layers
- Large canopy gaps
- Varied tree sizes and ages
- Dense understory in places

**Dead wood:**

- Standing snags (dead trees)
- Large fallen logs
- Decomposing wood everywhere
- Critical habitat

**Biodiversity:**

- Maximum species richness
- Rare specialist species
- Complex food webs
- Old-growth dependent species

## Why Old-Growth is Special

### Ecological Values

**Carbon storage:**

- Stores 30-70% more carbon than young forests
- Continues absorbing CO₂ for centuries
- Critical for climate regulation
- Both living trees and soil

**Water regulation:**

- Deep root systems
- High infiltration rates
- Stream flow stabilization
- Prevents erosion

**Biodiversity hotspot:**

- Maximum species diversity
- Endemic species strongholds
- Complex habitats
- Keystone species present

**Genetic reservoir:**

- Old individual trees
- Ancient genetics preserved
- Seeds from superior trees
- Disease resistance

## Costa Rican Old-Growth

### Remaining Areas

**Corcovado National Park:**

- Last major old-growth lowland rainforest
- Pacific coast
- Massive trees (Ceiba, Almendro)
- Critically endangered Harpy Eagles

**La Amistad International Park:**

- Largest protected area
- Border with Panama
- Elevation gradient 0-3800m
- Multiple old-growth forest types

**Monteverde Cloud Forest:**

- Pristine cloud forest
- Ancient trees with epiphytes
- High endemism
- Quetzal habitat

**Tortuguero:**

- Caribbean lowland rainforest
- Swamp forests
- Less accessible = better preserved
- Critical jaguar habitat

### What Was Lost

**Historical coverage:**

- Pre-1940s: Most of Costa Rica was old-growth
- 1987: Only ~21% forest remained
- Today: &lt;10% is true old-growth
- Most was cut 1950s-1980s

## Versus Secondary Forest

| Feature        | Old-Growth     | Secondary         |
| -------------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| Age            | 200+ years     | 0-100 years       |
| Tree size      | Very large     | Smaller           |
| Structure      | Complex layers | Simpler           |
| Dead wood      | Abundant       | Less common       |
| Biodiversity   | Maximum        | Lower             |
| Carbon storage | Maximum        | Growing           |
| Regeneration   | Gap-phase      | Pioneer-dominated |

## Indicator Species

### Trees Indicating Old-Growth

**Almendro** (_Dipteryx panamensis_):

- Long-lived canopy emergent
- Takes 100+ years to reach full size
- Great Green Macaw food source
- Logging nearly eliminated it

**Ceiba** (_Ceiba pentandra_):

- Lives 300-500 years
- Massive buttressed trunk
- Sacred to indigenous people
- Rainforest icon

**Ancient figs** (_Ficus_ spp.):

- Can live 500+ years
- Massive strangling forms
- Keystone species (fruit all year)
- Support hundreds of animal species

## Threats

### Why Old-Growth is Disappearing

**Logging:**

- Valuable hardwoods (Mahogany, Cocobolo)
- Selective logging degrades structure
- Roads open forest to settlement
- Illegal logging continues

**Conversion:**

- Cattle ranching
- Palm oil plantations
- Agriculture
- Development

**Fragmentation:**

- Isolated patches
- Edge effects
- Loss of connectivity
- Genetic isolation

**Climate change:**

- Altered rainfall
- Increased drought
- Higher temperatures
- Range shifts

## Conservation Value

### Why We Must Protect Old-Growth

**Irreplaceable:**

- Takes centuries to develop
- Cannot be recreated quickly
- Unique characteristics
- Cultural importance

**Biodiversity:**

- Many species require old-growth
- Endemics often restricted to it
- Top predators need large intact areas
- Extinction prevention

**Climate:**

- Massive carbon sinks
- Climate regulation
- Weather pattern influence
- Rainforest maintains itself

**Research:**

- Baseline ecosystems
- Undiscovered species
- Medicinal compounds
- Ecological processes

## Secondary Forest Can Become Old-Growth

### Recovery Timeline

**0-25 years:**

- Fast-growing pioneers
- Light-demanding species
- Simple structure

**25-75 years:**

- Canopy closes
- Shade-tolerant regeneration
- More complex structure
- Dead wood accumulating

**75-200 years:**

- Large trees developing
- Multiple canopy layers
- Increasing biodiversity
- Approaching old-growth conditions

**200+ years:**

- Old-growth characteristics
- Maximum biomass
- Complex structure
- Full species complement

## Economic Value

### Services Provided

**Tourism:**

- Ecotourism destinations
- Research stations
- Educational value
- International visitors

**Water:**

- Municipal watersheds
- Hydroelectric generation
- Agricultural water
- Coastal protection

**Non-timber products:**

- Fruits, medicines
- Genetic resources
- Seed sources for reforestation
- Traditional use by indigenous

## Why It Matters

Understanding old-growth helps with:

- **Conservation priorities**: Protect remaining areas
- **Restoration goals**: Know what to aim for
- **Carbon**: Recognize climate value
- **Biodiversity**: Protect specialist species
- **Cultural**: Respect indigenous connections

## What You Can Do

**Support old-growth:**

1. Visit protected areas (ecotourism)
2. Support conservation organizations
3. Choose certified sustainable wood
4. Reduce paper consumption
5. Learn and educate others
6. Support indigenous land rights
7. Advocate for protection
8. Plant native trees (future old-growth)
