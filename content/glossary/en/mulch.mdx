## What is Mulch?

Mulch is a protective blanket of material placed on the soil surface. In tropical agroforestry, mulch is most often produced by pruning nitrogen-fixing shade trees and spreading the leaves and small branches around crop plants.

## Types of Mulch

### Organic Mulch

- **Leaf litter**: Naturally falling leaves from canopy trees.
- **Green mulch**: Fresh prunings from hedgerows or shade trees.
- **Wood chips**: Chipped branches and bark.
- **Compost**: Partially decomposed organic matter.

### Living Mulch

- **Ground covers**: Low-growing plants that blanket the soil (e.g., tropical legumes like _Arachis pintoi_).

## Benefits

- **Moisture retention**: Reduces evaporation by 25–50%.
- **Temperature moderation**: Keeps soil 5–8°C cooler in direct sun.
- **Weed suppression**: Blocks light needed for weed germination.
- **Nutrient release**: Decomposing mulch slowly releases nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
- **Erosion control**: Protects soil from raindrop impact and surface runoff.

## Mulch from Costa Rican Trees

### Madero Negro (_Gliricidia sepium_)

Prunings decompose quickly, releasing nitrogen within 2–4 weeks — ideal for fast-growing crops.

### Guaba (_Inga edulis_)

Leaf litter is abundant and nutrient-rich; traditional shade-tree prunings are used as mulch in coffee plantations.

### Guarumo (_Cecropia_ spp.)

Large leaves make excellent short-term mulch in restoration plantings.

## Application in Costa Rica

- **Coffee farms**: Shade-tree prunings provide most or all mulch needs.
- **Home gardens**: Kitchen scraps plus tree prunings mulch vegetable beds.
- **Restoration sites**: Mulch around newly planted seedlings dramatically improves survival rates.
