## What is a Drip Tip?

A drip tip is the elongated, pointed tip found on the leaves of many tropical trees. It acts as a spout, channeling rainwater off the leaf surface quickly. This seemingly simple feature solves several problems faced by trees in wet tropical environments.

## Why Tropical Trees Need Drip Tips

In rainforests where annual rainfall exceeds 3,000 mm:

1. **Water film blocks light**: A persistent water film on the leaf reduces photosynthesis.
2. **Epiphyll colonization**: Wet leaf surfaces promote growth of mosses, lichens, and algae.
3. **Fungal disease**: Standing water enables pathogenic fungi to germinate and infect the leaf.
4. **Nutrient leaching**: Prolonged contact with water dissolves nutrients from the leaf.

## How It Works

- The elongated tip concentrates water flow into a single drip point.
- Surface tension pulls the water droplet to the tip where it detaches.
- The leaf dries in minutes rather than hours.

## Distribution

- **Most common**: Understory and midstory species in wet lowland forests.
- **Less common**: Canopy-top species (more wind-dried) and dry-forest species.
- **Characteristic feature**: One of the most recognized adaptations of tropical rainforest plants.

## Costa Rican Examples

### Lowland Caribbean Rainforest

Walk the trails of La Selva Biological Station and nearly every understory tree displays prominent drip tips — Guapinol, Almendro, and countless others.

### Cacao (_Theobroma cacao_)

Large leaves with prominent drip tips — essential for shedding water in the humid conditions where cacao grows best.

## Why It Matters

- **Identification**: Presence and degree of drip tips can help distinguish tropical from temperate species.
- **Forest health**: Drip tips reduce disease pressure on leaves.
- **Ecology**: Their prevalence correlates with mean annual rainfall — useful for interpreting fossil floras.
