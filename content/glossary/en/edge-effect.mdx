## What is the Edge Effect?

When a forest meets a pasture, road, or different habitat type, the boundary zone experiences dramatically different conditions from the forest interior. Temperatures rise, humidity drops, wind increases, and a new community of plants and animals appears. This phenomenon is the edge effect.

## Characteristics

### Abiotic Changes

- **Light**: 2–5× more light penetrates at edges.
- **Temperature**: Up to 4°C warmer than forest interior.
- **Humidity**: Significantly lower, causing desiccation stress.
- **Wind**: Increased turbulence, raising treefall risk.

### Biotic Changes

- **Species composition**: Pioneer and generalist species dominate edges.
- **Vine tangles**: Lianas and vines proliferate in the extra light.
- **Invasive species**: Edges serve as invasion corridors.
- **Altered pollination and seed dispersal**: Different animal communities.

## Edge Depth

The edge effect typically penetrates 50–300 m into the forest depending on the variable measured:

- Microclimate changes: 50–100 m
- Bird community shifts: 100–200 m
- Tree mortality increases: up to 300 m

## Costa Rican Context

Forest fragmentation in Costa Rica creates extensive edge habitat:

- **Guanacaste pastures**: Forest remnants are often entirely "edge" due to small patch sizes.
- **Biological corridors**: Edge effects are managed through buffer plantings.
- **Coffee farms**: Shade-coffee systems reduce edge severity compared to sun-coffee clear-cuts.

## Practical Significance

- **Conservation**: Small forest fragments may be entirely influenced by edge effects, reducing habitat quality.
- **Restoration**: Buffer plantings and wide corridors reduce harmful edge effects.
- **Agroforestry**: Strategic tree planting can leverage positive edge effects (pollinator habitat, pest predator refuges).
