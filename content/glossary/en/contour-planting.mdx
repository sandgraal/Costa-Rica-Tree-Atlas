simpleDefinition: "Planting trees or crops along lines of equal elevation on a hillside to slow water runoff and prevent erosion."
technicalDefinition: "A soil and water conservation practice in which rows of vegetation are established along contour lines (lines of constant elevation) perpendicular to the slope gradient, creating barriers that reduce surface runoff velocity, increase infiltration, and minimize soil loss."

## What is Contour Planting?

Contour planting means arranging trees, hedgerows, or crops in lines that follow the natural elevation contours of a hillside. Instead of planting up and down the slope (which channels water into erosive gullies), contour lines run perpendicular to the slope, creating natural speed bumps for rainwater.

## How It Works

1. **Survey contours**: Identify lines of equal elevation using an A-frame, clinometer, or GPS.
2. **Plant along contours**: Establish hedgerows, tree rows, or crop strips along these lines.
3. **Terrace formation**: Over time, sediment accumulates behind the plantings, creating natural terraces.
4. **Water infiltration**: Slowed runoff has time to soak into the soil rather than flowing downhill.

## Benefits

- **Erosion reduction**: Can reduce soil loss by 50–80% on moderate slopes.
- **Water conservation**: Increases soil moisture availability for crops and trees.
- **Terrace building**: Gradual natural terrace formation without expensive earthwork.
- **Productivity**: Better water and nutrient retention increases yields.

## Costa Rican Applications

### Coffee Hillsides

Shade trees planted along contours protect steep coffee farms in the Central Valley and Tarrazú regions.

### Pacific Slope Farms

Madero Negro hedgerows on contour lines protect annual crops from dry-season wind and wet-season erosion.

### Watershed Protection

Contour-planted riparian buffer strips along streams prevent sediment from entering waterways that supply drinking water.

## Why It Matters

- **Terrain**: Costa Rica's mountainous landscape makes contour planting essential — most agricultural land is on slopes.
- **Climate resilience**: As rainfall events become more intense with climate change, contour systems become more critical.
- **Payments for ecosystem services**: Contour management practices often qualify for Costa Rica's PES program.
