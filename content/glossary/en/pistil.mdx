## What is a Pistil?

The pistil is the female part of a flower - where seeds develop after pollination. It has three main parts: a sticky tip (stigma) that catches pollen, a stalk (style) connecting the parts, and a swollen base (ovary) containing ovules that become seeds.

## Structure

### Three Main Parts

**Stigma:**

- Pollen-receptive surface at top
- Often sticky or hairy
- May be lobed or feathery
- Receives pollen grains

**Style:**

- Stalk between stigma and ovary
- Pollen tubes grow through it
- Can be long or short, or absent
- One or multiple per flower

**Ovary:**

- Swollen base containing ovules
- Ovules become seeds after fertilization
- Ovary becomes fruit
- Contains one to many ovules

## Types of Pistils

### Simple Pistil (One Carpel)

**Single unit:**

- One ovary, style, stigma
- From one carpel
- Example: Pea, avocado

### Compound Pistil (Multiple Carpels)

**Fused carpels:**

- Appears as one pistil
- Multiple carpels joined
- Most common type
- Example: Tomato, mango

### Multiple Pistils

**Separate carpels:**

- Many individual pistils per flower
- Each makes its own fruit
- Example: Magnolia, blackberry

## Position in Flower

### Superior Ovary

**Above other parts:**

- Ovary at top of receptacle
- Stamens below ovary
- Becomes fruit with withered flower parts at base
- Example: Guanacaste, most legumes

### Inferior Ovary

**Below other parts:**

- Ovary embedded in receptacle
- Flower parts appear above ovary
- Becomes fruit with flower remnants on top
- Example: Mango, guava, apple

## Function

### Reproduction Process

1. **Pollination**: Pollen lands on stigma
2. **Germination**: Pollen grain sprouts pollen tube
3. **Growth**: Tube grows down through style
4. **Fertilization**: Sperm cells reach ovules in ovary
5. **Seed development**: Ovules become seeds
6. **Fruit development**: Ovary grows into fruit

## Costa Rican Examples

### Aguacate/Avocado (_Persea americana_)

- Simple pistil (one carpel)
- Becomes drupe fruit
- Large single seed
- Perfect flowers (both stamens and pistils)

### Mango (_Mangifera indica_)

- Compound pistil
- Inferior ovary
- One fertile carpel (4 others sterile)
- Drupe with large flat seed

### Ceiba (_Ceiba pentandra_)

- Compound pistil
- 5 carpels
- Long style projecting beyond stamens
- Becomes large capsule fruit

## Stigma Variations

### Types by Pollen Mode

**Dry stigma:**

- Wind-pollinated trees
- Non-sticky surface
- Feathery or branched
- Catches airborne pollen

**Wet stigma:**

- Insect/bird pollinated
- Sticky secretion
- Traps pollen grains
- Most Costa Rican trees

## Style Length

### Functional Adaptations

**Long styles:**

- Stigma extends beyond stamens
- Prevents self-pollination
- Accessed by long-tongued pollinators
- Example: Many trumpet flowers

**Short or no style:**

- Stigma near ovary
- Direct path for pollen tubes
- Quick fertilization
- Example: Some wind-pollinated trees

## Carpel Number and Fruit Type

| Carpels | Example Tree | Fruit Type |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| 1       | Avocado      | Drupe      |
| 2       | Jacaranda    | Capsule    |
| 3       | Palms        | Drupe      |
| 5       | Ceiba        | Capsule    |
| Many    | Magnolia     | Aggregate  |

## Ovule Development

### Before Fertilization

**Ovules in ovary:**

- Contain female gamete (egg)
- Awaiting fertilization
- Multiple per ovary
- Not all may be fertilized

### After Fertilization

**Seeds develop:**

- Fertilized ovules become seeds
- Unfertilized ovules abort
- Seed contains embryo
- Protected by seed coat

## Identifying Features

### Family Characteristics

**Fabaceae (legumes):**

- Single carpel
- Superior ovary
- Becomes pod (legume)

**Malvaceae (hibiscus family):**

- 5 carpels
- Compound pistil
- Style branches into 5 stigmas

**Anacardiaceae (mango family):**

- Usually 1-3 carpels
- Often only one fertile
- Drupes

## Economic Importance

### Fruit Production

**All fruits come from pistils:**

- Ovary develops into fruit
- Seeds inside from ovules
- Crucial for food production
- Pollination essential

## Why It Matters

Understanding pistils helps with:

- **Flower identification**: Number and arrangement diagnostic
- **Pollination**: Knowing fertilization requirements
- **Fruit prediction**: Ovary type indicates fruit type
- **Breeding**: Controlled crosses for hybrids
- **Yield**: Pistil health affects seed/fruit production

## Field Tips

**Examining pistils:**

1. Locate in flower center
2. Count stigma lobes (= carpels)
3. Check if sticky (touch gently)
4. Note length of style
5. Feel for ovary at base
6. Compare to stamen number

**Best time to observe:**

- Flower just opened
- Before pollination
- Stigma fresh and receptive
