## Visual Description

Pinnate leaves consist of multiple leaflets attached to a central stalk called the **rachis**. The arrangement resembles a bird's feather, with leaflets extending from both sides of the rachis.

### Types of Pinnate Leaves

**Simple Pinnate (Once-Pinnate)**

- Leaflets attached directly to the main rachis
- Example: Rose, Ash, Walnut

**Bipinnate (Twice-Pinnate)**

- Each leaflet is itself divided into smaller leaflets
- Common in tropical trees like Acacias and Jacarandas
- See: [Bipinnate](/en/glossary/bipinnate)

### Key Features

- **Leaflets**: Individual leaf-like structures that make up the compound leaf
- **Rachis**: The central stem to which leaflets attach
- **Terminal leaflet**: The leaflet at the tip (if present)
- **Lateral leaflets**: Leaflets along the sides

## Why It Matters

Understanding pinnate leaf structure helps with:

- **Tree identification**: Many tree families have characteristic pinnate leaves
- **Water management**: Pinnate leaves can shed excess water efficiently
- **Light capture**: Multiple leaflets allow flexible positioning for optimal photosynthesis

## Examples in Costa Rica

Many Costa Rican trees display pinnate leaves:

- **Guanacaste** (_Enterolobium cyclocarpum_): Bipinnate with tiny leaflets
- **Mahogany** (_Swietenia macrophylla_): Even-pinnate with 4-6 pairs of leaflets
- **Monkey Comb** (_Pithecellobium dulce_): Bipinnate with delicate appearance
