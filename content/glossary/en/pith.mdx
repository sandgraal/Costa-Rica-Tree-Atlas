## What is Pith?

The pith is the soft, spongy core at the very center of a tree's trunk or branch. In cross-section, it appears as a small, often darker circle right in the middle of the wood.

## Structure and Function

### Young Trees

- Stores nutrients and water
- Provides structural support in early growth
- May be photosynthetic in green stems

### Mature Trees

- Often dries out, shrinks, or becomes hollow
- No longer actively functional
- Heartwood forms around it

## Pith Shapes

Different species have characteristic pith shapes in cross-section:

- **Round**: Most common (e.g., Laurel)
- **Star-shaped**: Some Fabaceae members
- **Triangular**: Certain palms
- **Hollow**: Guarumo and other pioneer species

## Costa Rican Examples

### Balsa (_Ochroma pyramidale_)

Very large, soft pith — the entire wood is remarkably lightweight because of its large, thin-walled cells.

### Guarumo (_Cecropia obtusifolia_)

Hollow pith chambers house symbiotic Azteca ants — a classic example of myrmecophytism.

### Papaya (_Carica papaya_)

Almost entirely pith — the trunk is more like a giant herbaceous stem than true wood.

## Practical Significance

- **Wood quality**: Large pith can cause checking (splitting) in lumber.
- **Propagation**: Pith-rich cuttings root easily but may rot quickly.
- **Ecology**: Hollow pith provides nesting habitat for insects and small animals.
