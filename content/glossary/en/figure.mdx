## What is Figure?

Figure refers to decorative patterns in wood beyond regular grain. Highly figured wood commands premium prices and is prized for fine furniture, musical instruments, and decorative items.

## Types of Figure

### Natural Anatomical Figures

**Ribbon/Stripe Figure:**

- Alternating light and dark stripes
- Caused by interlocked grain
- Reflects light differently when planed
- Classic in mahogany and sapele
- Costa Rican example: Fine mahogany (_Swietenia_)

**Ray Fleck ("Medullary Rays"):**

- Shiny perpendicular lines or plates
- Visible wood rays in quarter-sawn lumber
- Prominent in oak, beech, sycamore
- Not common in Costa Rican tropical hardwoods

**Birdseye:**

- Small circular or oval marks resembling bird eyes
- Caused by bud formation compression
- Famous in maple
- Rare in tropical species

**Quilted:**

- Puffy, pillowy appearance
- Caused by wavy grain and light reflection
- Prized in maple and mahogany
- Creates 3D appearance

**Curly/Tiger Stripe:**

- Wavy perpendicular lines across grain
- Caused by wavelike grain formation
- Also called "fiddle-back" (violin wood)
- Creates chatoyance (shimmer effect)

### Stress and Defect Figures

**Burl:**

- Swirling, irregular grain patterns
- Caused by tree burls (growth abnormalities)
- Extremely valuable and decorative
- Costa Rican example: Pochote burls

**Spalting:**

- Dark zone lines from fungal infection
- Creates artistic patterns
- Wood must be stabilized before decay
- Popular in turned bowls and art pieces

**Crotch Figure:**

- V-shaped pattern from branch junction
- Feathery grain radiating from center
- Highly prized but structurally weaker
- Used for decorative veneers

**Fiddleback:**

- Tight wavy grain pattern
- Named for violin back wood
- Creates shimmering effect
- Prized in musical instruments

### Cutting-Induced Figures

**Quarter-Sawn:**

- Boards cut perpendicular to growth rings
- Emphasizes ray fleck
- More stable than flat-sawn
- Premium lumber cut

**Rift-Sawn:**

- Cut at angle to growth rings
- Minimizes figure, emphasizes straight grain
- Very stable
- Used where uniformity needed

**Rotary-Cut Veneer:**

- "Unrolled" log creates cathedral patterns
- Wide, dramatic grain patterns
- Used in plywood faces

## Costa Rican Figured Woods

### Premium Figured Species

**Cocobolo (_Dalbergia retusa_):**

- Dense rosewood with striking figure
- Orange-red to purple-black patterns
- Natural oils enhance figure
- Highly valued for small projects

**Caoba/Mahogany (_Swietenia macrophylla_):**

- Classic ribbon stripe figure
- Interlocked grain creates shimmer
- Premium grades show best figure
- CITES-protected, limited availability

**Cristóbal (_Platymiscium pinnatum_):**

- Rosewood family with beautiful figure
- Golden-brown with dark streaks
- Occasional quilted or curly patterns
- Excellent for fine furniture

**Laurel (_Cordia alliodora_):**

- Can show wavy or interlocked grain
- Best logs have subtle figure
- Popular for domestic furniture
- More affordable than mahogany

**Pochote Burls:**

- Spectacular swirling patterns
- Rare and highly valued
- Used for turned bowls, art
- Must be properly dried to prevent cracking

### Recognizing Figure Potential

**In Standing Trees:**

- Burls visible as lumps on trunk
- Wavy bark may indicate curly grain
- Crotches worth examining
- Stress from lean creates compression wood

**In Logs:**

- End grain shows growth irregularities
- Burls obvious on outside
- Professionals use moisture/light to preview
- High-figure logs command 5-10x premium

## Woodworking Implications

### Working Figured Wood

**Challenges:**

- Irregular grain direction causes tear-out
- Difficult to plane and sand
- Requires very sharp tools
- May need scraping instead of planing

**Solutions:**

- Reduce planer depth of cut
- Use high cutting angle (60°+)
- Sand with progression of grits
- Consider hand-scraping for finest work

### Finishing Figured Wood

**Enhancing Figure:**

- Clear finishes emphasize patterns
- Oil finishes bring out chatoyance
- Avoid opaque stains that hide figure
- Multiple thin coats better than thick

**Best Finishes:**

- Danish oil for cocobolo
- Shellac for traditional look
- Lacquer for production furniture
- Polyurethane for durability

## Market Value

### Price Multipliers

**Standard Lumber:** 1x base price
**Subtle Figure:** 2-3x
**Moderate Figure:** 3-5x
**Exceptional Figure:** 5-10x+
**Burls:** 10-50x+

**Factors:**

- Species rarity
- Figure type and intensity
- Size of figured area
- Market demand
- Cultural preferences

## Conservation Consideration

### Sustainable Use

Figured wood is rare:

- Only small percentage of trees show figure
- Selective logging for figure = more waste
- Burl harvesting can damage/kill trees
- Consider plantation alternatives

**Responsible Choices:**

- Verify legal/sustainable source
- Check CITES documentation for protected species
- Consider domestic species over imports
- Use figured wood sparingly as accent
- Value and preserve historic figured pieces

## Why It Matters

Understanding figure helps with:

- **Wood selection**: Choosing appropriate species for projects
- **Pricing**: Understanding why some boards cost more
- **Woodworking technique**: Adapting methods to grain
- **Sustainability**: Appreciating rarity drives conservation
- **Identification**: Figure patterns help ID wood species
