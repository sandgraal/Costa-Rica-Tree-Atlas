## What is Alley Cropping?

Alley cropping arranges trees in parallel rows with crops planted in the "alleys" between them. The trees provide shade, wind protection, nitrogen fixation, and mulch from periodic pruning, while the crops fill the productive space between rows.

## How It Works

1. **Tree rows**: Planted 4–10 m apart depending on species and crops.
2. **Crop alleys**: Annual crops (maize, beans, squash) or perennials (coffee, cacao) grow between the trees.
3. **Periodic pruning**: Trees are cut back to manage shade and produce mulch/green manure.
4. **Nutrient cycling**: Leaf litter and prunings add organic matter and nutrients to the crop zone.

## Common Tree Species in Costa Rica

### Nitrogen Fixers

- **Madero Negro** (_Gliricidia sepium_): Most common — fast-growing, easy to prune, fixes nitrogen.
- **Guaba** (_Inga edulis_): Provides shade for coffee and cacao while enriching soil.
- **Poró** (_Erythrina poeppigiana_): Traditional shade tree for coffee plantations.

### Timber Trees

- **Pochote** (_Pachira quinata_): Dry-forest timber species that provides long-term timber income.
- **Laurel** (_Cordia alliodora_): Combines timber production with crop shading.

## Benefits

- **Soil improvement**: Increased organic matter and nitrogen availability.
- **Erosion control**: Tree roots stabilize slopes; mulch protects soil surface.
- **Income diversification**: Trees provide timber, fruit, or firewood alongside crop income.
- **Biodiversity**: Tree rows create habitat corridors through agricultural landscapes.

## Costa Rican Applications

- **Coffee + Poró/Guaba**: The most common alley cropping system in Costa Rica's Central Valley.
- **Maize + Madero Negro**: Common in Guanacaste's smallholder farms.
- **Cacao + Laurel**: Caribbean lowland agroforestry combining shade-grown cacao with valuable timber.
