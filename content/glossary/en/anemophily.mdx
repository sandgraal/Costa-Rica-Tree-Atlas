## What is Anemophily?

Anemophily is wind pollination — trees that release pollen into the air and rely on wind currents to carry it to receptive flowers on other trees. It is a "shotgun" approach: wind-pollinated trees produce enormous quantities of pollen because the chances of any single grain reaching a target flower are small.

## Characteristics of Wind-Pollinated Trees

### Flowers

- Small, inconspicuous — no need to attract animals.
- No bright colors, scent, or nectar.
- Often appear before leaves (to reduce obstruction).
- Long, dangling catkins or exposed anthers.

### Pollen

- Produced in vast quantities (millions of grains per tree).
- Lightweight, smooth, dry — aerodynamically optimized.
- Often causes allergies in humans.

### Stigmas

- Large, feathery, or sticky — designed to catch airborne pollen.

## Wind vs. Animal Pollination

| Feature        | Anemophily (Wind)    | Zoophily (Animal) |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- |
| Pollen volume  | Enormous             | Moderate          |
| Pollen size    | Small (20–30 μm)     | Larger, sticky    |
| Flower display | Small, inconspicuous | Showy, colorful   |
| Nectar         | Absent               | Present           |
| Efficiency     | Low (wasteful)       | High (targeted)   |

## Costa Rican Wind-Pollinated Trees

### Roble Encino (_Quercus_ spp.)

Highland oaks produce catkins that release clouds of pollen during the dry season — the primary cause of seasonal allergies in Costa Rica's Central Valley.

### Pino Caribeño (_Pinus caribaea_)

Male cones produce enormous quantities of yellow pollen carried by wind to female cones — classic conifer pollination.

### Ciprés (_Cupressus lusitanica_)

Wind-pollinated conifer planted extensively in Costa Rican highlands; significant allergen source.

## Why It Matters

- **Allergies**: Wind-pollinated trees are the main source of tree pollen allergies.
- **Forestry**: Understanding pollination ensures successful seed production in plantations.
- **Ecology**: Wind pollination is favored in environments with sparse pollinator populations (highlands, plantations).
