# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "none"
toxicParts: []
skinContactRisk: "none"
allergenRisk: "low"
structuralRisks:
  - "falling-branches"
  - "heavy-fruit"
childSafe: true
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "Amarillón (Terminalia amazonia) is non-toxic and safe. No parts of this tree are poisonous to humans or animals. The Combretaceae family includes some species with medicinal properties, but Terminalia amazonia does not have significant toxic compounds. Safe for use in landscapes, reforestation, and areas where people and animals are present."
skinContactDetails: "No known skin irritation from contact with bark, sap, or leaves. Wood dust during milling should be handled with standard protective equipment (dust masks), as with any hardwood, but the tree itself poses no dermal hazards. Safe to touch and handle."
allergenDetails: "Minimal allergenic properties. Some individuals may have mild reactions to pollen during flowering season. Wood dust during processing may cause respiratory irritation (mechanical, not allergenic). Overall risk is low."
structuralRiskDetails: "VERY LARGE tree reaching 40-60 meters (130-200 feet) tall—one of the forest giants. Falling branches from such height are potentially serious hazards. Heavy winged fruits (samaras) fall from great height. Not suitable for small residential properties. Requires professional care if planted in developed areas. Best suited for large properties, parks, and reforestation projects where its massive size is appropriate."
safetyNotes: "Amarillón is safe from a toxicity standpoint but must be respected for its enormous size. This is an emergent forest giant that towers above the canopy. It's appropriate for large-scale reforestation, extensive properties, and parks—not for typical residential yards. The tree itself is non-toxic and safe, but its sheer size creates structural considerations. Give it the space its dimensions require."
wildlifeRisks: "Safe for wildlife. Important food source for forest fauna. No toxic effects on animals."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "fast"
growthRateDetails: "2-3 m/year (6-10 ft/year) - fast-growing emergent; can reach 30+ m in 20-25 years; one of the faster native hardwoods"
matureSize: "40-60 m tall (130-200 ft) - EMERGENT FOREST GIANT; trunk diameter 80-150 cm; crown spread 20-30 m; dominates canopy"
hardiness: "Tropical lowlands to mid-elevations 0-1200m; prefers humid rainforest; frost-sensitive; best below 800m"
soilRequirements: "Deep, fertile, well-drained soils essential for optimal growth; tolerates range of soil types but prefers rich alluvial soils; pH 5.5-7.0; needs good drainage despite moisture requirements"
waterNeeds: "moderate"
waterDetails: "Moderate to high water needs. Prefers 2500-4500mm annual rainfall. Requires consistent moisture especially when young. Natural habitat is humid rainforest with year-round rain. Once established, moderately tolerant of short dry periods."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plant 10-15 m apart for timber plantations; 15-20 m for mixed reforestation; 25+ m from buildings - this is MASSIVE tree"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
  - "seedlings"
propagationDifficulty: "easy"
plantingSeason: "Start of rainy season (May-June); winged seeds germinate readily; plant fresh seeds"
maintenanceNeeds: "LOW to MODERATE maintenance forest giant. Years 1-3: weed control important; water during dry periods; protect from damage. Years 3-10: minimal intervention; formative pruning optional for timber quality. Year 10+: essentially self-sufficient. Timber rotation: 30-40 years for excellent structural-grade wood (golden-yellow heartwood highly valued). REFORESTATION CHAMPION: Fast growth + excellent timber + emergent height makes Amarillón ideal for mixed-species plantations. Provides upper canopy while slower species grow beneath. Good choice for degraded land restoration with commercial value. SIZE CONSIDERATION: This is 40-60m EMERGENT - plant only where massive size appropriate."
commonProblems:
  - "ENORMOUS SIZE (40-60m) - unsuitable for 99% of residential properties; needs vast space"
  - "Falling branches from 40-60m height potentially dangerous; keep away from structures/paths"
  - "Heavy winged fruits (samaras) fall from extreme height"
  - "Young trees compete with aggressive vegetation; weed control first 2-3 years"
  - "Browsing damage from deer/cattle when young; protect if necessary"
  - "Requires deep soils - shallow rocky sites limit growth potential"
  - "Minimal pest/disease issues - generally healthy and vigorous"
  - "Professional tree care required for any work on mature specimens (extreme height)"
  - "NOT for small properties, urban lots, or confined spaces - this is FOREST GIANT"
  - "EXCELLENT for: large-scale reforestation, timber plantations, forest restoration, parks"
  - "One of best native choices for commercial forestry: fast growth + valuable timber + emergent size"

# Amarillón

<Callout type="success" title="A Forest Giant">
  **Amarillón** (_Terminalia amazonia_) is one of the most impressive trees in
  Central American rainforests. As an emergent species, it towers above the
  canopy, with some individuals exceeding 60 meters in height. Its yellow-gold
  wood is highly valued for construction.
