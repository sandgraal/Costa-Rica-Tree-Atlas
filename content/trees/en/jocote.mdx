# Jocote

<Callout type="success" title="The Beloved Seasonal Fruit">
  The **Jocote** (_Spondias purpurea_), known as Spanish Plum or Red Mombin, is
  one of Costa Rica's most culturally significant fruit trees. This small, hardy
  tree produces abundant crops of tangy-sweet fruits that Ticos eagerly await
  each season. From the tart green "jocotes verdes" eaten with salt and lime, to
  the sweet ripe purple ones called "jocotes maduros," these fruits are a
  quintessential taste of Costa Rica. Living fences of jocote line roads
  throughout the countryside, and the sight of a tree heavy with ripe fruit is a
  beloved signal that the harvest season has arrived. Whether eaten fresh,
  dried, candied, or made into "chicha de jocote," this Mesoamerican native
  holds a special place in Costa Rican hearts and cuisine.

## Physical Description

### Overall Form

The Jocote is a small to medium deciduous tree with a spreading crown and characteristically thick, soft branches. The tree has remarkably easy vegetative reproduction—large branch cuttings stuck in the ground readily root and grow, which has made it one of the most common living fence trees in Mesoamerica.

## Cultivation

### Growing Jocote

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="The Easy Way: Cuttings">
    **The Traditional Method**: Jocote is famously easy to propagate from
    cuttings: 1. Cut a large branch (5-15 cm diameter, 1-2 m long) 2. Let the
    cut end dry for a few days 3. Plant directly in the ground (stake if needed)
    4. Water initially, then reduce 5. New growth appears in weeks **Why This
    Works**: - Thick, corky branches store water - Roots form readily from cut
    surfaces - No need for rooting hormone - Large "cutting" is actually small
    tree! This method is why jocote living fences are so common.
  </AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="From Seed">
  **Alternative Method**: - Plant fresh seed from ripe fruit - Germination in
  2-4 weeks - Genetic variation (good for breeding) - Takes longer to fruit (3-5
  years) - Used for variety development
</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Care and Harvest">
    **Maintenance**: - Minimal once established - Tolerates poor soil - Drought
    resistant - Prune for shape if desired - Few serious pest problems
    **Harvesting**: - For verde: Pick green, firm - For maduro: Wait for color
    change - Shake branches for ripe fruit - Multiple harvests per season -
    Handle carefully (bruise easily)

<Callout type="success" title="The Taste of Home">
  For Costa Ricans, the jocote is more than just a fruit—it's a taste of home, a
  marker of seasons, and a thread connecting generations. The sight of a jocote
  tree heavy with purple fruit brings back childhood memories: climbing trees in
  abuela's backyard, roadside stops where vendors sell "jocotes con sal," the
  tangy-sweet explosion of flavor that says "this is my country." From the
  pre-Columbian Maya to today's Tico families, the jocote has been cultivated
  and cherished, its genetics shaped by millennia of human selection. Those
  living fences lining country roads? They're not just practical—they're an
  edible landscape, a communal resource, a tradition planted one branch cutting
  at a time. When you eat a jocote in Costa Rica, you're participating in a
  tradition that stretches back thousands of years. That tart burst of flavor?
  That's Mesoamerican civilization on your tongue.
