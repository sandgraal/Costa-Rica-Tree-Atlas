# Cedro Amargo

<Callout type="tip" title="The Fragrant Treasure">
  **Cedro Amargo** (_Cedrela odorata_), known as Spanish Cedar in English, is
  one of the most prized timber trees in the Western Hemisphere. Despite its
  common name, it is not a true cedar but a member of the mahogany family. Its
  aromatic, rot-resistant wood has been treasured for centuries for fine
  furniture, cigar boxes, and boat building, making it a tree of immense
  cultural and economic significance throughout Latin America.

<Callout type="info" title="Not a True Cedar">
  Despite being called "Spanish Cedar" or "Cedro," _Cedrela odorata_ is not
  related to true cedars (_Cedrus_ species) of the Mediterranean and Himalayas.
  It belongs to the mahogany family (Meliaceae), alongside big-leaf mahogany
  (_Swietenia macrophylla_). The "cedar" name comes from the similar aromatic,
  insect-repelling properties of its wood.

### Distinctive Features

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Trunk & Bark

- **Bark**: Gray-brown, deeply fissured and scaly
- **Wood**: Pinkish-brown, aromatic, lightweight

- **Leaflets**: 10-22, opposite
- **Leaflet Shape**: Lanceolate to elliptic
- **Size**: Leaves 30-60 cm total length
- **Scent**: Crush leaves for garlic/onion-like odor
- **Timing**: Deciduous in dry season

</Column>
<Column>

#### Flowers

- **Color**: Cream to greenish-white
- **Size**: Small (5-6 mm)
- **Arrangement**: Terminal panicles, 20-40 cm
- **Season**: April to June (Costa Rica)
- **Fragrance**: Sweet, attracts bees
- **Gender**: Functionally unisexual on same tree

#### Fruits & Seeds

- **Type**: Woody capsule
- **Size**: 2.5-5 cm long
- **Shape**: Oblong-ellipsoid

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

<Callout type="tip" title="Field Identification Tip">
  The easiest way to identify Cedro Amargo in the field is to crush a leaf and
  smell it. The distinctive garlic-onion odor is unmistakable and quite
  different from the pleasant cedar scent of the wood. The deeply fissured bark
  on mature trees is also diagnostic.

### Distribution in Costa Rica

Cedro Amargo occurs throughout Costa Rica, from the dry forests of Guanacaste to the wet lowlands of the Caribbean. However, centuries of exploitation have made large individuals increasingly rare outside protected areas.

## Ecological Significance

### Forest Regeneration

<Callout type="success" title="Pioneer Species">
  Cedro Amargo is a light-demanding species that thrives in forest gaps and
  disturbed areas. This pioneer behavior, combined with rapid growth, makes it
  valuable for reforestation and forest restoration projects. It can grow 2-3
  meters per year in optimal conditions.
</Callout>

### Wildlife Interactions

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Pollinators

- **Bees**: Primary pollinators
- **Moths**: Nocturnal pollination
- **Wind**: Contributes to pollen movement
- **Small insects**: Various visitors

#### Seed Dispersers

- **Wind**: Primary dispersal mechanism
- **Gravity**: Seeds fall from parent tree
- **Water**: Can float to new locations

</Column>
<Column>

#### Pest Interactions

- **Shoot Borer**: _Hypsipyla grandella_ is a serious pest
- **Moth larvae**: Bore into growing tips
- **Impact**: Causes multiple stem growth
- **Management**: Major challenge for plantations

#### Other Wildlife

- **Cavity nesters**: Use old trees
- **Epiphytes**: Host orchids, bromeliads
- **Insects**: Support various species

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

<Callout type="warning" title="The Shoot Borer Problem">
  The mahogany shoot borer (_Hypsipyla grandella_) is the main obstacle to Cedro
  plantations throughout Latin America. The moth larvae bore into the terminal
  shoot, killing it and causing the tree to develop multiple stems, dramatically
  reducing timber value. No effective control has been found despite decades of
  research.

## Cultural & Economic Importance

### The Ultimate Cigar Wood

<FeatureBox title="Cigar Box Heritage" icon="🚬">
  Cedro Amargo has been the wood of choice for **premium cigar boxes and
  humidors** for over 200 years. Its aromatic properties help maintain proper
  humidity while its natural oils repel tobacco beetles. Cuban cigars, Dominican
  cigars, and fine cigars worldwide are stored and aged in Spanish cedar. A
  single high-quality Cedro log can be worth thousands of dollars for this
  market.

/>

### Conservation Concerns

<Callout type="warning" title="Centuries of Exploitation">
  Cedro Amargo has been commercially exploited for over 500 years. The largest,
  finest specimens have been systematically removed from forests throughout its
  range. Today: - **Large trees are rare** even in protected areas - **Genetic
  diversity** may be compromised - **Natural regeneration** is slow in many
  areas - **Illegal logging** continues despite protections The species is not
  at immediate risk of extinction due to its wide range and fast growth, but
  ecologically and commercially important populations are severely depleted.

## Cultivation & Propagation

### Growing Cedro Amargo

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Propagation Methods

**From Seeds (Standard Method)**

1. Collect seeds from mature capsules (Oct-Feb)
2. Seeds lose viability quickly (weeks to months)
3. Sow immediately in nursery beds
4. Light soil coverage only
5. Germination in 15-25 days
6. Transplant at 30-40 cm height
7. Full sun required

**Plantation Challenges**

- Shoot borer attacks young trees
- Mixed planting reduces attack rates
- Enrichment planting in existing forest recommended

</Column>
<Column>

#### Growing Conditions

<SimpleList
  items={[
    "Sun: Full sun essential",
    "Soil: Fertile, well-drained",
    "Water: Moderate, drought tolerant once established",
    "Spacing: 8-12 m for timber",
    "Growth Rate: 2-3 m/year possible",
    "First Harvest: 25-40 years for timber",
  ]}
/>

#### Plantation Strategies

- Plant with nurse trees for shoot borer management
- Mixed species plantations more successful
- Enrichment planting in secondary forest
- Select resistant genotypes when available

<Callout type="tip" title="The Legacy of Cedro Amargo">
  When you see a large Cedro Amargo tree today, you're looking at a survivor.
  Centuries of exploitation have made large specimens rare treasures. These
