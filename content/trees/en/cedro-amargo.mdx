# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "none"
toxicParts: []
skinContactRisk: "low"
allergenRisk: "moderate"
structuralRisks: []
childSafe: true
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "The tree itself poses no toxicity hazard. Leaves, bark, flowers, and seeds are non-toxic to humans and animals. The tree is safe for planting in gardens, parks, and areas accessible to children and pets. No ingestion toxicity reported."
skinContactDetails: "Direct contact with living plant parts (leaves, bark, flowers) is generally safe with minimal irritation risk. However, some sensitive individuals may experience mild skin reactions from prolonged contact with fresh bark or sap. Overall skin contact risk for most people is very low."
allergenDetails: "Wood dust from Cedro Amargo is a MODERATE TO HIGH allergen for woodworkers and carpenters. Documented reactions include asthma, sneezing, coughing, respiratory irritation, nasal inflammation, skin blistering, and dermatitis. In rare cases, nasal cancer has been linked to chronic exposure. The aromatic oils (thujone, phenols) in freshly cut wood can trigger respiratory symptoms in sensitive individuals. Always wear protective equipment (dust mask, gloves, eye protection) when cutting, sanding, or machining this wood. Ensure good ventilation in workshops. For most people encountering the living tree or finished wood products (furniture, cigar boxes), allergen risk is minimal."
safetyNotes: "The LIVING TREE is completely safe for gardens, parks, and home landscapes - children and pets can play near it without concern. The primary safety consideration is for WOODWORKERS: wood dust is a respiratory sensitizer and skin irritant. Professional carpenters, furniture makers, and hobbyist woodworkers should use dust collection systems, wear N95 or P100 respirators, and protect skin when working with Cedro Amargo lumber. Finished wood products (furniture, musical instruments) pose no risk to end users. The tree's aromatic, termite-resistant properties come from natural oils that cause occupational health concerns only during wood processing."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "fast"
growthRateDetails: "Fast growth; 1-2 m/year in good conditions; reaches 15m in 10-12 years; can achieve commercial timber size (25-30m) in 20-25 years; significantly faster than mahogany"
matureSize: "30-40 m tall (can exceed 40m in ideal sites), crown spread 15-20 m; straight trunk to 1-1.5 m diameter; impressive canopy tree"
hardiness: "Tropical moist to wet forests; 0-1200m elevation; prefers humid conditions but more adaptable than strict rainforest species; both slopes of CR"
soilRequirements: "Prefers deep, fertile, well-drained soils; pH 5.5-7.0; grows best on alluvial or volcanic soils; tolerates moderate clay but not waterlogged conditions; benefits from organic matter"
waterNeeds: "moderate"
waterDetails: "Moderate water needs. Young trees need weekly watering during dry periods first 2-3 years. Established trees tolerate seasonal drought better than strict rainforest species but produce best with consistent moisture. Suitable for both wet and moderately seasonal areas."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plant 10-15 m from buildings for shade/ornamental use; 3-5 m spacing in timber plantations; needs full sun for optimal growth"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
  - "tissue culture"
propagationDifficulty: "moderate"
plantingSeason: "Plant at start of rainy season (May-June) ideal; seeds germinate in 2-3 weeks; moderate success rate; seedlings grow rapidly once established"
maintenanceNeeds: "MODERATE maintenance timber/shade tree. VULNERABLE species due to over-exploitation - plant for conservation. Years 1-3: water weekly in dry season, weed control critical, protect from shoot borer (Hypsipyla grandella - major pest). Years 4-10: prune to develop straight single trunk for timber, remove competing vegetation, monitor for shoot borer damage (prune infested shoots immediately). Fertilization beneficial in poor soils. Mature trees: minimal care for shade trees; timber harvesting at 20-25 years sustainable. NOTE: Shoot borer moth is MAJOR limitation - larvae bore into terminal shoots causing forking and reducing timber quality. Intercropping with non-mahogany-family trees reduces attack."
commonProblems:
  - "SHOOT BORER (Hypsipyla grandella) - #1 problem, attacks terminal shoots, ruins timber form - plant mixed with other species to reduce damage"
  - "Over-exploitation has made wild populations vulnerable - conservation planting important"
  - "Leaf-cutting ants can defoliate young trees - control critical first 2-3 years"
  - "Slow to establish if planted in poor soils without weed control"
  - "Susceptible to root rot if planted in waterlogged soils"
  - "Timber value attracts theft of trees from plantations"
  - "Requires decades to reach harvestable timber size - long-term investment"

<Callout type="info" title="Not a True Cedar">
  Despite being called "Spanish Cedar" or "Cedro," _Cedrela odorata_ is not
  related to true cedars (_Cedrus_ species) of the Mediterranean and Himalayas.
  It belongs to the mahogany family (Meliaceae), alongside big-leaf mahogany
  (_Swietenia macrophylla_). The "cedar" name comes from the similar aromatic,
  insect-repelling properties of its wood.

## Cultural & Economic Importance

### The Ultimate Cigar Wood

<FeatureBox title="Cigar Box Heritage" icon="🚬">
  Cedro Amargo has been the wood of choice for **premium cigar boxes and
  humidors** for over 200 years. Its aromatic properties help maintain proper
  humidity while its natural oils repel tobacco beetles. Cuban cigars, Dominican
  cigars, and fine cigars worldwide are stored and aged in Spanish cedar. A
  single high-quality Cedro log can be worth thousands of dollars for this
  market.

### Conservation Concerns

<Callout type="warning" title="Centuries of Exploitation">
  Cedro Amargo has been commercially exploited for over 500 years. The largest,
  finest specimens have been systematically removed from forests throughout its
  range. Today: - **Large trees are rare** even in protected areas - **Genetic
  diversity** may be compromised - **Natural regeneration** is slow in many
  areas - **Illegal logging** continues despite protections The species is not
  at immediate risk of extinction due to its wide range and fast growth, but
  ecologically and commercially important populations are severely depleted.
