## Overview

_Tecoma stans_, commonly known as Sardinillo in Costa Rica or Yellow Bells in English, is one of the most widespread and recognizable flowering plants in the Americas. This versatile member of the Bignoniaceae family ranges from the southwestern United States through Central America to Argentina, making it one of the most broadly distributed native species in the Western Hemisphere.

In Costa Rica, Sardinillo is ubiquitous. It grows wild along roadsides, in vacant lots, on rocky hillsides, and in forest edges from sea level to 2,000 meters elevation. It is equally at home in the hot, dry lowlands of Guanacaste and the temperate highlands of the Central Valley. This remarkable adaptability, combined with nearly year-round flowering, makes it perhaps the most versatile native ornamental plant available to Costa Rican gardeners.

The plant's common name "Sardinillo" in Costa Rica refers to its elongated seed pods, which resemble small sardines. The flowers are bright, butter-yellow trumpets produced in terminal clusters, attracting a constant stream of bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds. Each cluster may contain 20-50 flowers that open successively over weeks, ensuring a long display period.

Beyond its ornamental value, Sardinillo has been used for centuries in traditional medicine across Latin America. The leaves and bark contain alkaloids with documented hypoglycemic properties, and research continues into their potential for diabetes management. The plant is also valued for erosion control, living fences, and as a critical pollinator resource in urban environments.

### Taxonomic Notes

_Tecoma stans_ was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 as _Bignonia stans_, then transferred to the genus _Tecoma_ by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu in 1789. The genus name _Tecoma_ is derived from the Nahuatl (Aztec) word _tecomaxochitl_, meaning "clay pot flower," referring to the shape of the blooms. Two main varieties are recognized: _T. stans_ var. _stans_ (typical form with pinnate leaves) found throughout the range, and _T. stans_ var. _velutina_ (with densely pubescent leaves) found in drier habitats of Mexico and Central America. The species is the official flower of the U.S. Virgin Islands (as "Yellow Cedar") and the national flower of the Bahamas.

## Physical Description

### Plant Form

Sardinillo is a large, semi-evergreen shrub or small tree typically reaching 3–10 meters in height. In favorable conditions with deep soil and ample moisture, it can occasionally reach 10 meters, but most specimens remain in the 3–5 meter range, especially when pruned. The plant often develops multiple stems from the base, forming a dense, bushy crown. However, it can be trained as a single-trunk small tree with formative pruning.

### Bark

The bark is thin, light gray to tan, smooth on young stems and becoming slightly fissured on older trunks. Young branches are green and somewhat angular, becoming rounded and woody with age. The inner bark is light-colored and fibrous.

### Leaves

Leaves are opposite, pinnately compound with 3–13 leaflets (typically 5–7). Leaflets are lanceolate to ovate, 3–10 cm long and 1–4 cm wide, with serrate (toothed) margins and acuminate tips. The foliage is bright green, somewhat glossy, and semi-evergreen — dropping partially during severe drought but retaining most leaves through the dry season in most Costa Rican locations.

### Flowers

The flowers are the plant's defining feature. They are bright, butter-yellow, trumpet-shaped (campanulate), 3–5 cm long, with five fused petals forming a tube that flares into rounded, slightly ruffled lobes. Faint orange or red lines mark the throat, serving as nectar guides for pollinators. Flowers are borne in terminal racemes of 10–50 blooms, opening sequentially from the base upward over several weeks. Flowering occurs virtually year-round in Costa Rica, with peak production during the dry season (December–April) and after heavy rains.

### Fruit and Seeds

The fruit is a narrow, linear capsule 10–20 cm long and 0.5–0.8 cm wide, resembling a small bean pod or sardine (hence the common name). Capsules are green when young, drying to brown and splitting to reveal numerous flat, winged seeds approximately 5 mm long with two delicate membranous wings for wind dispersal. Fruit production is prolific and nearly continuous.

Sardinillo is found throughout all seven provinces of Costa Rica, making it one of the most widely distributed native plants in the country. It thrives in the hot dry forests of Guanacaste, the humid Caribbean lowlands of Limón, the temperate Central Valley, and the premontane slopes up to about 2,000 meters. It is particularly common in disturbed habitats — roadsides, pasture edges, fence lines, vacant lots, and urban areas — where its pioneer nature and drought tolerance give it a competitive advantage.

### Broader Distribution

_Tecoma stans_ has one of the broadest natural ranges of any Neotropical plant, extending from southern Arizona and Florida in the United States through Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean to northern Argentina. It has been introduced and naturalized in tropical regions worldwide, including Africa, Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands, where it can occasionally become invasive.

/>

### Ecological Role

Sardinillo plays a disproportionately important ecological role relative to its size. As one of the few native plants that flowers nearly year-round, it provides a continuous food source for pollinators when other species are dormant or between flowering periods. This makes it a keystone species for maintaining pollinator populations in urban and agricultural landscapes.

The plant's pioneer nature means it rapidly colonizes disturbed areas, stabilizing soil and initiating ecological succession. Its root system helps prevent erosion on slopes and riverbanks. In degraded landscapes, Sardinillo often serves as a "nurse plant" that creates microhabitat conditions favorable for the establishment of larger tree species.

### Wildlife Associations

- **Pollinators**: Honeybees, native stingless bees, carpenter bees, bumblebees, various butterflies, hummingbirds
- **Seed dispersers**: Wind (anemochory); birds occasionally consume seeds
- **Herbivores**: Leaf-cutter ants (_Atta_ spp.) occasionally harvest foliage
- **Insect associations**: Host plant for sphinx moth larvae (Sphingidae); larval food for several butterfly species
- **Bird habitat**: Dense growth provides nesting sites for small birds

### Ecological Adaptations

Sardinillo's extraordinary success across such diverse environments is due to several key adaptations:

- **Drought tolerance**: Deep taproot and reduced leaf area during water stress
- **Fire resilience**: Resprouts vigorously from root crowns after fire
- **Prolific reproduction**: Continuous seed production with wind dispersal ensures colonization
- **Soil flexibility**: Thrives in nutrient-poor subsoils and rocky substrates
- **Light optimization**: Rapid growth toward light openings in forest gaps

### Ornamental Value

Sardinillo is one of the most popular and widely planted ornamental shrubs in tropical and subtropical gardens worldwide. Its continuous production of bright yellow flowers, ease of care, drought tolerance, and adaptability to pruning make it ideal for:

- Flowering hedges and screens
- Foundation plantings
- Specimen focal points
- Container gardening
- Highway median plantings
- Public park displays

### Traditional Medicine

_Tecoma stans_ has a long history of medicinal use throughout the Americas. The most significant traditional use is as a treatment for diabetes — indigenous peoples and rural communities have used leaf infusions to help control blood sugar levels for centuries. Scientific research has validated these uses:

- **Hypoglycemic effects**: Alkaloids tecomanine and tecostanine have documented blood-sugar-lowering properties
- **Anti-inflammatory**: Leaf extracts show anti-inflammatory activity in laboratory studies
- **Antimicrobial**: Various plant extracts demonstrate activity against certain bacteria and fungi
- **Antioxidant**: Rich in phenolic compounds with free-radical scavenging activity

**Note**: Medicinal use should be supervised by qualified healthcare professionals. Do not self-treat diabetes or any condition with plant preparations.

### Honey Production

Beekeepers across the Americas consider Sardinillo one of the most valuable honey plants. Its year-round flowering provides constant nectar flow, supporting colony health during periods when other forage is unavailable. The honey produced is light-colored with a mild, pleasant flavor.

---

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Sardinillo holds cultural importance across the Americas. In El Salvador, it is the national flower (known as "Flor de San Andrés"). In the U.S. Virgin Islands, it is the territorial flower (as "Yellow Cedar"). In many Central American communities, its constant golden flowers symbolize cheerfulness and resilience.

In Costa Rica, Sardinillo is a familiar and beloved sight in both rural and urban landscapes. Its presence along country roads and in rural gardens is deeply associated with the Costa Rican paisaje (landscape). Older generations recognize it as a medicinal plant — "para el azúcar" (for sugar/diabetes) — and maintain patches near kitchen gardens for occasional medicinal use.

### Indigenous and Traditional Uses

Pre-Columbian peoples of Mesoamerica extensively utilized _Tecoma stans_. The Nahuatl name _tecomaxochitl_ indicates its importance in Aztec culture. Uses included:

- **Medicine**: Leaf and bark preparations for digestive and inflammatory conditions
- **Dye**: Yellow dye extracted from flowers
- **Construction**: Stems used in light construction and tool handles
- **Spiritual**: Associated with sun symbolism and fertility in some traditions

---

## Conservation Status

Sardinillo is classified as **Least Concern (LC)** by the IUCN. It is one of the most common and widespread native plants in the Americas, with stable or expanding populations. Its ability to colonize disturbed habitats, tolerate extreme conditions, and reproduce prolifically ensures that it faces no conservation threats. In some regions outside its native range, it is actually considered invasive and requires management.

---

## Growing Sardinillo

### Site Selection

Choose a location with full sun for best flowering performance. Sardinillo tolerates nearly any well-drained soil type, including poor, rocky, and alkaline soils. Avoid waterlogged areas. The plant is extremely heat-tolerant and drought-resistant, making it ideal for challenging sites where other ornamentals struggle.

### Propagation

**From Seed**: Collect dry brown pods when they begin splitting. Seeds germinate readily in 7–14 days without pretreatment. Direct sow or start in containers. Self-seeding occurs freely once established.

**From Cuttings**: Semi-hardwood cuttings (20–30 cm) taken during the growing season root easily in 3–4 weeks. Dip in rooting hormone for best results. This method produces flowering plants more quickly than seed.

### Planting and Care

- Plant at any time during the rainy season in Costa Rica
- Minimal soil preparation needed — Sardinillo thrives in poor soil
- Water regularly for first 2–3 months, then only during severe drought
- Prune after each major flush to maintain shape and encourage reblooming
- No fertilizer needed in most soils; excessive nitrogen promotes leaves over flowers

/>

### Pest and Disease Management

Sardinillo is remarkably pest-resistant. Occasional issues include:

- **Whiteflies**: May congregate on young growth; spray with water jets or insecticidal soap
- **Leaf-cutter ants**: May harvest foliage; use ant baits if damage is significant
- **Aphids**: Occasional infestations on tender new growth; usually controlled by natural predators
- **Spider mites**: Can appear during very dry, dusty conditions; increase humidity around plant
- **Root rot**: Only in waterlogged soils — ensure good drainage

---

## Where to See Sardinillo

### In Costa Rica

- **Throughout the Central Valley**: Roadside plantings, gardens, and naturalized in vacant areas
- **Guanacaste Province**: Common along roads and in dry forest edges
- **San José**: Urban parks and residential gardens
- **Monteverde area**: Both planted and wild specimens up to 1,800 m elevation
- **Pacific coastal towns**: Common in beach town landscaping
- **Rural roadsides nationwide**: Naturalized along most highways and country roads

### Best Viewing

Sardinillo flowers year-round in Costa Rica, but peak displays occur during January–April (dry season) and immediately after the first heavy rains of the wet season. Look for the bright yellow trumpet clusters against the backdrop of dry-season landscapes.

## Advanced Care Guidance

### Site Design and Planting

- Establish in full sun with 3-4 m spacing for hedgerows and 5-6 m for standalone ornamental trees.
- Tolerates poor and rocky soils, but best flowering occurs in well-drained loam with moderate compost incorporation.
- Plant at rainy-season onset and keep a 50-70 cm mulch ring free from direct trunk contact.

### Watering Program

- **Establishment (0-4 months):** Water 2-3 times weekly if rainfall is irregular.
- **Development (4-18 months):** Deep watering every 7-10 days during dry season.
- **Mature plants:** Drought tolerant, but monthly deep watering in severe drought maintains bloom cycles.

### Fertilization Schedule

- Use a moderate balanced formula (12-12-12 or 15-15-15) at early and mid-rainy season.
- In highly leached soils, add micronutrient support (Mg, Zn, B) once per year.
- Avoid high nitrogen late in rainy season, which drives weak vegetative growth instead of flowering.

### Pruning and Structure

- Train a clear trunk if tree form is desired, or maintain multi-stem shape for habitat hedges.
- Prune lightly after major flowering flushes to stimulate branching and repeat blooms.
- Remove dead interior twigs annually to improve light penetration and disease prevention.

### Pest and Disease Management

- Watch for whiteflies, aphids, and scale on tender growth; encourage natural predators.
- Root and collar rot risk increases in poorly drained heavy clay.
- Sanitation pruning and controlled irrigation are usually sufficient for disease suppression.

### Companion Planting

- **Recommended companions:** Flor de Itabo, Nance, native salvias, and pollinator herbs.
- **Landscape role:** Excellent bee and hummingbird support species for dry-forest gardens.
- **Avoid nearby:** Dense, highly competitive canopy trees that suppress flowering with heavy shade.

### Seasonal Care Calendar (Costa Rican Conditions)

- **Dry season (Dec-Apr):** Selective irrigation, mulch reinforcement, and light renewal pruning.
- **Early rains (May-Jul):** Fertilize, plant new individuals, and monitor sap-feeding insects.
- **Peak rains (Aug-Oct):** Drainage checks, fungal scouting, and tip pruning only if needed.
- **Transition (Nov):** Shape correction and bloom planning for the next cycle.

### Growth Timeline and Flowering Notes

- Rapid establishment in warm lowland and premontane sites.
- First strong flowering events usually appear within 12-24 months.
- Regular light pruning plus controlled fertility produces the most continuous ornamental display.
