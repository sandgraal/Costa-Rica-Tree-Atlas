# Caoba (Big-leaf Mahogany)

<Callout type="tip" title="The Red Gold of the Americas">
  **Caoba** (_Swietenia macrophylla_), known worldwide as Big-leaf Mahogany, is
  arguably the most famous tropical hardwood on Earth. Its reddish-brown wood,
  prized for its beauty, workability, and durability, has driven centuries of
  exploitation that pushed the species to the brink. Today, it stands as a
  symbol of both the destructive potential of the timber trade and the promise
  of sustainable forestry when managed properly.

  the Caribbean islands, and Pacific Coast Mahogany (_S. humilis_) of Central
  America's dry Pacific slope. All three are threatened by overexploitation, but
  Big-leaf Mahogany, with its larger size and wider range, has been the primary
  target of the timber industry.

## Physical Description

### Overall Form

The Caoba is a large deciduous tree with a tall, straight trunk and a broad, spreading crown. Mature trees are emergent giants, rising above the surrounding forest canopy with distinctive large buttress roots.

- **Color**: Greenish-yellow
- **Size**: Small (6-9 mm)
- **Arrangement**: Axillary panicles
- **Season**: April to June (Costa Rica)
- **Gender**: Functionally unisexual

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

<Callout type="tip" title="The Magnificent Capsule">
  The Caoba fruit capsule is unmistakable—a large, woody, egg-shaped structure
  that stands erect on the branch. When it opens from the base, it resembles a
  wooden flower, releasing dozens of winged seeds that spin as they fall. These
  empty capsules can persist on the tree for months, making them useful for
  identification year-round.

### Distribution in Costa Rica

Caoba originally occurred throughout Costa Rica's lowland forests on both slopes, but centuries of selective logging have made it extremely rare in the wild. Today, most Caoba sightings are in protected areas or plantations.

## Ecological Significance

### Forest Ecology

<Callout type="success" title="Keystone Canopy Species">
  In pristine forests, Caoba trees are **ecological giants**. Their emergent
  crowns create important canopy structure, their flowers provide nectar during
  lean periods, and their massive seed production feeds numerous wildlife
  species. The loss of large Caoba trees has cascading effects throughout the
  forest ecosystem.
</Callout>

### Wildlife Interactions

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Seed Ecology

- **Wind**: Primary dispersal agent
- **Parrots**: Consume and destroy many seeds
- **Squirrels**: Predators and occasional dispersers
- **Howler Monkeys**: Consume young seeds
- **Insects**: Various seed predators

#### Pollinators

- **Bees**: Primary pollinators
- **Moths**: Secondary pollinators
- **Small insects**: Various visitors

</Column>
<Column>

#### Tree Associations

- **Epiphytes**: Support abundant orchids, bromeliads
- **Lianas**: Provide connections in canopy
- **Cavity nesters**: Old trees provide nest sites
- **Bats**: Roost in hollow trunks

#### Pest Interactions

- **Shoot Borer**: _Hypsipyla grandella_
- **Same pest** as Cedro Amargo
- **Major limitation** for plantations
- **Natural forests**: Less severely affected

## Cultural & Economic Importance

### The World's Premier Hardwood

<FeatureBox title="Centuries of Demand" icon="🪵">
  Mahogany has been the **gold standard** for fine furniture since the 17th
  century. Its combination of beauty, workability, stability, and durability is
  unmatched by any other tropical hardwood. From colonial ship building to Queen
  Anne furniture to modern luxury interiors, mahogany has shaped tastes and
  driven economies for over 400 years. A single large mahogany log can be worth
  $10,000 or more.

## Conservation Status

    { label: "IUCN Red List", value: "Endangered (2023)" },
    { label: "CITES Status", value: "Appendix II (since 2003)" },

    { label: "Commercial Status", value: "Heavily regulated" },
  ]}
/>

### The Crisis

<Callout type="warning" title="A Cautionary Tale">
  Big-leaf Mahogany illustrates the consequences of unsustainable extraction: -
  **Caribbean populations**: Commercially extinct by 1900 - **Central American
  populations**: Severely depleted by mid-1900s - **South American
  populations**: Now the primary target, declining rapidly - **Overall**: 70%+
  population decline over 3 generations (150 years) Despite CITES listing,
  illegal logging continues throughout its range. Large, high-quality trees are
  increasingly rare in natural forests.
</Callout>

### CITES Protection

<FeatureBox title="CITES Appendix II" icon="📋">
  Since 2003, all international trade in Big-leaf Mahogany requires **CITES
  documentation** proving legal and sustainable harvest. This includes: - Export
  permits from country of origin - Non-detriment findings (sustainable harvest
  verified) - Chain of custody documentation - Import verification in
  destination countries This regulation has helped reduce illegal trade but
  enforcement varies widely.

## Cultivation & Propagation

### Growing Caoba

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Propagation Methods

**From Seeds**

1. Collect seeds from mature capsules (Jan-Mar)
2. Seeds have short viability (weeks)
3. Sow immediately, light coverage
4. Keep moist; germination in 2-4 weeks
5. Transplant at 30-50 cm height
6. Requires full sun

**Plantation Challenges**

- **Shoot borer** (_Hypsipyla grandella_) attacks
- Pure plantations highly vulnerable
- Mixed planting improves outcomes
- No fully effective control method

</Column>
<Column>

#### Growing Conditions

<SimpleList
  items={[
    "Sun: Full sun essential",
    "Soil: Deep, fertile, well-drained",
    "Water: Regular, drought-sensitive when young",
    "Spacing: 8-12 m for timber production",
    "Growth Rate: 1-2 m/year possible",
    "Harvest Age: 30-50+ years for quality timber",
  ]}
/>

#### Best Practices

- Plant under nurse trees to reduce borer attack
- Mixed species plantations recommended
- Enrichment planting in existing forest
- Select sites carefully (fertile, well-drained)

## Identification Guide

### How to Identify Caoba

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Key Identification Features" defaultOpen={true}>
    **Definitive Characteristics:**

    1. **Large woody capsules** (12-20 cm) standing erect
    2. **Even-pinnate leaves** with asymmetric leaflets
    3. **Large buttress roots** on mature trees
    4. **Gray-brown bark** in rectangular plates
    5. **Reddish wood** visible on any cut surface
    6. **Emergent crown** above forest canopy

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Similar Species">
    Trees that might be confused with Caoba:

    <DataTable
      headers={["Species", "Difference from Caoba"]}
      rows={[
        ["_Cedrela odorata_", "Smaller capsules, garlic-scented leaves"],

        ["_Swietenia humilis_", "Smaller tree, Pacific dry forest"],
        ["_Khaya_ species", "African mahoganies, not native"],

    The large erect capsule and asymmetric leaflets are diagnostic for Big-leaf Mahogany.

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Seasonal Recognition">
    **Dry Season (January-April):** Semi-deciduous, capsules opening and releasing seeds

    **Early Wet Season (May-June):** Flowering, new leaf flush
