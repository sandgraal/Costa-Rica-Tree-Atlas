toxicityDetails: "CAUTION WITH SEEDS. The seeds (sapucaia nuts/paradise nuts) are edible and nutritious (high oil and protein), similar to Brazil nuts. HOWEVER, some Lecythis species are selenium accumulators—if grown on selenium-rich soils, the seeds can contain dangerously high selenium levels causing severe poisoning (hair loss, nausea, vomiting, neurological problems). Seeds from non-seleniferous soils are safe, but it's difficult for consumers to know the source. ONLY consume seeds from trusted sources and in limited quantities. The tree itself, bark, leaves, and flowers are non-toxic."
skinContactDetails: "LOW risk. Fresh nut shells may contain irritating substances. Use gloves when handling fruits. The tree itself is safe to touch."
allergenDetails: "LOW allergen risk. Standard wood dust precautions apply. Not a significant allergen."
safetyNotes: "TREE IS SAFE, SEEDS REQUIRE CAUTION. The living tree poses no hazard and is beautiful with its large woody 'pot' fruits. The seeds are potentially edible BUT can be dangerous due to selenium accumulation in certain soils. DO NOT consume wild-collected seeds without expert knowledge of the growing site. Commercial seeds should only be from verified safe sources. Keep seeds away from children and pets. The spectacular 'monkey pot' fruits make excellent natural containers but don't eat unknown seeds."

# Olla de Mono (Monkey Pot Tree)

<Callout type="warning" title="Endangered Rainforest Giant">
  The **Olla de Mono** (_Lecythis ampla_), known as the Monkey Pot Tree, is one
  of Costa Rica's most fascinating and endangered rainforest trees. Named for
  its unique pot-shaped fruits that can trap curious monkeys, this magnificent
  relative of the Brazil nut was once common in Atlantic lowland forests. Today,
  overexploitation for its valuable timber has pushed it to **Endangered
  status** in Costa Rica.

## The Remarkable "Monkey Pot"

### Nature's Perfect Trap

The Olla de Mono gets its name from one of nature's most ingenious fruit designs. The woody, pot-shaped fruits have a removable lid that falls off when ripe, exposing nutritious seeds inside. Legend has it that monkeys reach into the pot to grab seeds, make a fist around them, and then cannot withdraw their hand—becoming "trapped" by their own greed.

<Callout type="info" title="Truth Behind the Legend">
  While the monkey trap story is likely exaggerated, the fruit's design is
  genuinely remarkable:

- **Pot diameter**: 10-15 cm wide
- **Wall thickness**: 1-2 cm of woody tissue
- **Lid (operculum)**: Detaches cleanly when ripe
- **Seeds**: 15-25 per fruit, arranged neatly inside
- **Purpose**: Seeds released gradually as animals access them

## Edible Seeds

### Paradise Nuts

The seeds of Olla de Mono are edible and nutritious, similar to Brazil nuts but with an important caution:

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Nutritional Value

- **Protein**: High protein content
- **Fat**: Rich in healthy oils
- **Minerals**: Good source of selenium
- **Taste**: Mild, creamy, like Brazil nut
- **Preparation**: Usually eaten raw or roasted

</Column>
<Column>

#### Important Warning

<Callout type="error" title="Hair Loss Caution">
  **Excessive consumption of Lecythis seeds can cause temporary hair loss.**

The seeds contain high levels of selenium, which in excess causes a condition
called selenosis. Symptoms include:

- Hair loss
- Nail brittleness
- Gastrointestinal upset

Traditional knowledge limits consumption to small amounts. This is why the
seeds never became a major commercial product like Brazil nuts.

## Conservation Status

### Assessment

<Callout type="error" title="Endangered in Costa Rica">
  The Olla de Mono is classified as **Endangered** according to Costa Rican
  conservation assessments (IUCN 1988). While global status may differ, the
  species has declined dramatically within Costa Rica due to:

- Logging for valuable timber
- Loss of primary lowland forest
- Slow growth and reproduction
- Limited remaining habitat

</Callout>

### Threats

  headers={["Threat", "Severity", "Details"]}
  rows={[
    [
      "Timber extraction",
      "Critical",
      "High-value wood drives selective logging",
    ],
    [
      "Deforestation",
      "High",
      "Atlantic lowlands heavily converted to agriculture",

## Timber Value

### Why This Tree Was Logged

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Wood Properties

- **Density**: Very heavy, durable
- **Grain**: Interlocked, decorative
- **Color**: Reddish-brown heartwood
- **Durability**: Extremely resistant to rot and insects
- **Workability**: Difficult due to hardness

</Column>
<Column>

#### Traditional Uses

- **Heavy construction**: Bridges, wharves, pilings
- **Shipbuilding**: Keels, frames, planking
- **Flooring**: High-traffic areas
- **Railway ties**: Extreme durability
- **Exterior use**: Outdoor structures

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

<Callout type="warning" title="The Cost of Quality">
  Ironically, the Olla de Mono's exceptional wood quality led to its downfall.
  As one of the most durable timbers in Central American forests, it was
  selectively targeted for demanding applications—bridges, shipbuilding, railway
  ties—where only the best wood would suffice. This demand, combined with the
  tree's slow growth, created unsustainable pressure.

## Ecological Relationships

### Wildlife Interactions

<DataTable
  headers={["Animal", "Relationship", "Notes"]}
  rows={[
    ["Agoutis", "Seed disperser", "Cache and sometimes forget seeds"],
    ["Squirrels", "Seed consumer", "Gnaw through fruit walls"],

    ["Monkeys", "Seed consumer", "Target for the 'trap' legend"],
    ["Large bees (Eulaema)", "Pollinator", "Essential for reproduction"],
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="info" title="Obligate Pollination">
  The Olla de Mono depends on large-bodied bees, particularly orchid bees of the
  genus _Eulaema_, for pollination. The flower's complex structure with its
  hooded stamens requires strong, specialized pollinators. If these bee
  populations decline, the tree cannot reproduce—another layer of vulnerability.
</Callout>

## Cultural Uses

### The Perfect Container

Long before plastics, the woody fruits of the Olla de Mono served as natural containers:

- **Drinking cups**: Traditional calabash-style use
- **Salt holders (saleros)**: Hence one of its common names
- **Seed storage**: Natural seed banks
- **Decorations**: Carved and painted
- **Birdhouses**: Modern creative use

<Callout type="tip" title="Finding Fruits">
  Even where the living trees are rare, monkey pot fruits persist for years on
  the forest floor. These durable "pots" are sometimes collected and sold in
  craft markets—a testament to their remarkable construction.
