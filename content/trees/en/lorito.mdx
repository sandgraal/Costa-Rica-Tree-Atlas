/>

### Etymology

The genus name _Oreopanax_ comes from Greek _oros_ (mountain) + _Panax_ (the ginseng genus), referring to the mountain-dwelling nature of these trees and their relationship to ginseng in the same family (Araliaceae). The species epithet _xalapensis_ refers to Xalapa (also spelled Jalapa), a city in Veracruz, Mexico, near where the species was first scientifically described.

The common name **"Lorito"** (little parrot) refers to the leaf shape, which resembles a parrot's foot. Alternative names like "Mano de León" (lion's hand) and "Mano de Tigre" (tiger's hand) similarly refer to the distinctive palmate leaves.

### Family Relationships

The Araliaceae (ginseng family) includes about 1,500 species worldwide, many of tropical and montane distribution. Notable relatives include:

- **_Panax ginseng_** - Asian ginseng, medicinal plant
- **_Hedera helix_** - English ivy
- **_Schefflera_** species - Umbrella trees, popular houseplants
- **_Aralia_** species - North American aralias

## Physical Description

### Tree Form

**Lorito** is a small to medium evergreen tree or large shrub typically reaching 8-15 meters in height with a trunk diameter of 15-30 cm. The growth form is characteristic:

- **Trunk**: Usually single-stemmed but can be multi-trunked; relatively slender
- **Bark**: Smooth, gray to gray-brown, with light lenticels
- **Crown**: Rounded to irregular, relatively open; branches spreading
- **Growth Pattern**: Evergreen; maintains foliage year-round
- **Form**: Often somewhat irregular or asymmetric, lending it a distinctive character

### Leaves

<PropertiesGrid>
  <PropertyCard icon="🍃" label="Type" value="Simple, palmate (deeply lobed)" />
  <PropertyCard icon="📏" label="Size" value="15-30 cm diameter" />
  <PropertyCard icon="🌿" label="Lobes" value="5-9 deep lobes" />
  <PropertyCard icon="🎨" label="Color" value="Dark green above, paler below" />

  />
  <PropertyCard
    icon="🔄"
    label="Arrangement"
    value="Alternate, clustered at branch tips"
  />
</PropertiesGrid>

**Detail**: The leaves are the tree's most distinctive feature. Large and deeply palmately lobed (5-9 lobes), they resemble an outstretched hand or parrot's foot—hence the common names. Each lobe is 8-15 cm long, elliptic to lanceolate, with toothed margins. The upper surface is dark green and somewhat glossy, while the lower surface is paler and may have a slightly fuzzy texture when young. Leaves are borne on long petioles (leaf stalks) 10-20 cm long, allowing them to move gracefully in the wind. The leaves tend to cluster at the tips of branches, creating an attractive layered appearance.

Juvenile leaves may have fewer lobes and a different shape than mature leaves, a phenomenon common in the Araliaceae family.
