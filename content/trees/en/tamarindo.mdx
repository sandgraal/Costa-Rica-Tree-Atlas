# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "none"
toxicParts: []
skinContactRisk: "none"
allergenRisk: "low"
structuralRisks: []
childSafe: true
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "Tamarind fruit is safe and highly nutritious. The pulp is commonly consumed worldwide. Seeds are edible when cooked. No toxic parts. Safe for children and pets in normal quantities. Tamarind is a common food ingredient with a long history of safe consumption. The fruit is naturally high in tartaric acid which gives it the sour taste - this is not harmful and is actually beneficial."
skinContactDetails: "No significant skin hazards. The fruit pulp, leaves, and bark do not cause skin irritation. The pods are handled safely. No latex or irritating compounds present. Generally safe to handle."
allergenDetails: "Tamarind allergy is rare but documented. Reactions can include oral allergy syndrome, skin rashes, or in rare cases anaphylaxis. Cross-reactivity with other legumes (soy, peanuts) is possible but uncommon. The seeds contain trypsin inhibitors which are inactivated by cooking. Most people tolerate tamarind well - it's a common food ingredient worldwide."
safetyNotes: "SAFE FOR CONSUMPTION. Tamarind fruit is a common food enjoyed by children and adults. The tangy pulp is used in beverages, candies, and cooking. Children love tamarind candy. The fruit is an excellent source of vitamins and minerals. Pets can eat small amounts safely. The tree is safe to plant in parks, gardens, and near homes. No significant hazards. The pods fall naturally when ripe and don't pose a risk. This is an excellent shade tree that produces delicious, safe fruit. Tamarind is one of the safest tropical fruit trees."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "slow"
growthRateDetails: "Slow to moderate growth; 0.3-0.6 m/year; very slow first 3-5 years, then accelerates; begins fruiting at 6-8 years (grafted) or 10-15 years (seedlings); reaches mature size in 25-30 years; extremely long-lived (200+ years)"
matureSize: "15-25 m tall, crown spread 12-20 m; develops massive spreading canopy with age; exceptional old trees can be 30m+ tall and 25m+ wide"
hardiness: "Tropical dry to moist forests; lowlands 0-1000m; extremely adaptable; tolerates heat, drought, coastal conditions; thrives in Guanacaste dry season"
soilRequirements: "Highly adaptable; grows in sand, loam, clay, rocky soils; tolerates poor soils; pH 5.5-8.0; prefers deep well-drained soils but survives in marginal sites; benefits from occasional fertilization but not required"
waterNeeds: "low"
waterDetails: "Very drought-tolerant once established (3-5 years). Young trees need weekly watering first 2 dry seasons. Mature trees survive entirely on seasonal rainfall including extended dry periods (5-6 months). One of the most drought-resistant fruit trees. Overwatering not beneficial - tamarind adapted to dry forest conditions."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plant 10-15 m from buildings due to eventual massive size; 12-20 m from other large trees; needs space for wide-spreading crown; excellent standalone specimen tree"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
  - "grafting"
  - "air layering"
propagationDifficulty: "easy"
plantingSeason: "Plant in rainy season (May-June) best; seeds germinate easily in 1-2 weeks; can plant year-round with irrigation; highly successful establishment rate"
maintenanceNeeds: "VERY LOW maintenance - one of the easiest fruit trees. Years 1-3: water weekly during dry season, remove competing weeds, no fertilization needed. Years 4-10: minimal care, water only in extreme drought, prune only to remove dead wood or shape crown. Mature trees: essentially maintenance-free, harvest fruit when pods turn brown and crack open (December-March), occasional pruning to remove crossing branches or dead wood. No pest or disease problems of significance. No fertilization required - nitrogen-fixing legume improves its own soil. Ideal low-maintenance shade and fruit tree for large properties."
commonProblems:
  - "Very slow growth first 5 years discourages planters - patience required, this is long-lived tree"
  - "Takes 10-15 years to fruit from seed (grafted trees faster) - invest in grafted varieties for quicker production"
  - "Pods attract ants, wasps, and wildlife when ripe - normal, not harmful"
  - "Messy leaf drop and pod fall - plant away from pools, walkways if this is concern"
  - "Massive eventual size surprises people - ensure adequate space before planting"
  - "Falling pods in windy conditions can be startling but not dangerous"
  - "Virtually pest and disease-free - one of the most trouble-free tropical trees"

# Tamarindo (Tamarind)

<Callout type="success" title="The Sweet-Sour Sensation">
  The **Tamarind** (_Tamarindus indica_) is a grand leguminous tree that has
  conquered the tropical world with its irresistibly tangy fruit. Originally
  from Africa, tamarind traveled along ancient trade routes to become essential
  in cuisines from India to Mexico, Thailand to the Caribbean. Its brown, sticky
  pulp—sweet, sour, and complex—flavors countless dishes, beverages, and
  candies. In Costa Rica, no summer is complete without ice-cold "refresco de
  tamarindo," and vendors hawk tamarind candies at every town fiesta. Beyond its
  culinary gifts, the Tamarind is a magnificent shade tree, its feathery foliage
  and massive trunk making it one of the most recognizable and beloved trees in
  the tropical landscape.

## Cultivation

### Growing Tamarind

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Site Requirements">
    **Ideal Conditions**: - Full sun (essential) - Deep, well-drained soil -
    Hot, dry climate preferred - Space for massive growth - Drought-tolerant
    once established **Consider**: - Trees get VERY large - Deep taproot -
    Long-lived (plan for generations) - Slow initial growth
  </AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Propagation">
  **From Seed**: - Scarify or soak seeds - Germination in 1-2 weeks - Variable
  fruit quality - Trees fruit in 6-10 years **Vegetative** (commercial): -
  Grafting for superior varieties - Air layering - Ensures fruit quality -
  Fruits faster (3-4 years)
</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Care and Harvest">
    **Watering Requirements**:
    - **Young trees (Years 1-3)**: Water weekly during first two dry seasons
    - **Established trees**: Extremely drought-tolerant—survives on seasonal rainfall alone
    - After year 3-5, natural rainfall usually sufficient even in Guanacaste dry zone
    - One of the most water-efficient fruit/shade trees
    - Overwatering not beneficial—adapted to dry forest conditions
    - Deep watering during extreme drought can improve fruit quality

    **Fertilization Schedule**:
    - **Generally NOT NEEDED**: Tamarind is nitrogen-fixing legume
    - Young trees may benefit from light balanced fertilizer if growing in very poor soil
    - Mature trees thrive without fertilization
    - Tree improves its own soil through nitrogen fixation
    - Compost mulch beneficial but not essential
    - **Note**: One of the lowest-maintenance fruit trees for fertilization

    **Pruning Guidelines**:
    - **Minimal pruning required**
    - Young tree training: Allow natural spreading form to develop
    - Remove dead, damaged, or crossing branches as needed
    - Can lightly prune to raise canopy if needed for access
    - Mature trees rarely need pruning
    - Best time: Late dry season before new growth
    - Large trees may shed branches naturally—clear fallen limbs

    **Pest & Disease Management**:
    - **Exceptionally pest/disease-free**
    - Scale insects: Occasional issue—usually not requiring treatment
    - Virtually no serious pest problems
    - Borers in very stressed trees—keep tree healthy
    - One of the most trouble-free tropical trees

    **Harvest Guidelines**:
    - Pods ready December-March (main dry season)
    - Mature pods turn brown and shell becomes brittle
    - Crack open pods to extract sticky pulp and seeds
    - Can be harvested over extended period—pods don't spoil on tree
    - Yields increase with age: 100-300+ kg per mature tree
    - Pods store well—can be dried for long-term storage
    - Process pulp by removing seeds, can freeze or dry for later use

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Companion Planting">
    **Beneficial Companions**:
    - **Shade-tolerant crops under canopy**: Ginger, turmeric, shade coffee (light filtered shade)
    - **Pasture integration**: Excellent scattered shade tree in silvopasture—improves forage quality
    - **Annual crops while young**: Beans, squash, melons between young trees
    - **Other nitrogen-fixers**: Compatible with other legume trees

    **Compatible Trees**:
    - Other drought-tolerant species:
      - Neem (Azadirachta indica)
      - Mango (full sun required)
      - Cashew (compatible spacing)
      - Moringa (light filtered shade tolerant)
      - Native dry forest species

    **Plants to Avoid**:
    - High-water requirement crops (tamarind creates dry microclimate)
    - Shallow-rooted plants competing with tamarind's deep taproot
    - Shade-intolerant crops directly under mature canopy

    **Agroforestry Applications**:
    - **Silvopasture**: Premier shade tree for cattle—improves forage, provides shelter
    - **Living fence**: Can be planted as boundary tree (ensure adequate spacing)
    - **Alley cropping**: Wide spacing allows crop production between rows while young
    - **Urban forestry**: Excellent park and street tree (plan for massive size)
    - **Reforestation**: Good for restoring degraded dry forest lands

    **Traditional Integration**:
    - Town squares and plazas—iconic shade tree
    - Ranch and farm shade—provides livestock shelter
    - Roadside planting—erosion control and shade
    - School and park specimen—multi-generational planning tree

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Year-Round Care Calendar (Dry Tropical Zone)">
    **December-April (Dry Season/Harvest)**:
    - Peak pod harvest period (December-March)
    - Minimal care required—tree thrives in dry conditions
    - Young trees may benefit from monthly deep watering
    - Mature trees need NO intervention
    - Collect and process pods regularly

    **May-June (Flowering/Early Rains)**:
    - Tree flowers as rains arrive
    - New leaf flush begins
    - No special care needed
    - Natural rainfall sufficient
    - Pods from previous season finishing harvest

    **July-October (Rainy Season)**:
    - Pods developing for next dry season harvest
    - Active growth period
    - No watering needed—natural rainfall more than adequate
    - Optional: Apply compost mulch if desired (not necessary)

    **November (Late Rainy/Transition)**:
    - Tree preparing for dry season
    - Pods beginning to mature
    - No care required
    - Assess tree health—usually excellent

    **Note**: Tamarind is one of the lowest-maintenance fruit/timber trees. Once established (3-5 years), requires essentially ZERO input. Ideal for planting and forgetting. Rewarding for multi-generational properties—grandchildren will harvest from trees you plant today.

<Callout type="success" title="The Tree That Conquered the Tropics">
  From its origins in the African savanna to its status as an essential
  ingredient in cuisines from Bangkok to Guanacaste, the Tamarind has traveled
  farther and embedded itself deeper than almost any other fruit tree. Its
  secret is that irresistible sweet-sour complexity— a flavor impossible to
  replicate synthetically, that somehow works equally well in a Thai curry, a
  Mexican candy, and a Costa Rican refresco. But beyond its culinary magic, the
  Tamarind is simply a magnificent tree: those massive, ancient-looking trunks,
  the delicate feathery foliage that folds at dusk like a prayer, the dense
  shade that has cooled generations of tropical towns. When you drink an
  ice-cold agua de tamarindo in the shade of a centuries-old tree, you're
  participating in a tradition that spans continents and millennia. That's the
  gift of the Tamarind—a taste of the tropical world in every tangy-sweet sip.
