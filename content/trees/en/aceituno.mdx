# Aceituno

<Callout type="success" title="The Paradise Tree">
  The **Aceituno** (_Simarouba amara_), also known as **Paradise Tree** or
  **Bitterwood**, is a remarkable fast-growing rainforest tree valued across the
  Americas for its potent medicinal properties, lightweight wood, and oil-rich
  seeds. Indigenous peoples have used its bitter bark for centuries to treat
  fevers, parasites, and digestive ailments.

<AccordionItem title="🔬 Taxonomic Notes">

The family Simaroubaceae is known for producing bitter compounds (quassinoids) used medicinally. The genus name _Simarouba_ comes from a Galibi (Caribbean indigenous) word for the tree, while _amara_ means "bitter" in Latin—referring to the intensely bitter bark.

**Medicinal Family**: The Simaroubaceae includes other famous medicinal plants like Quassia (_Quassia amara_) and Tree of Heaven (_Ailanthus altissima_).

**Chemical Profile**: The bitter compounds that make the bark medicinally valuable also make the wood naturally resistant to termites and other insects.

<Callout type="success" title="The Bitter Medicine Tree">

_The Aceituno (Simarouba amara) exemplifies how nature's pharmacy and sustainable
forestry can work together. Its intensely bitter bark has healed people across
the Americas for centuries, while its fast growth and adaptability make it a
champion for reforestation. As interest grows in its oil-rich seeds for biofuel,
this humble pioneer tree may play an even larger role in sustainable land use._
