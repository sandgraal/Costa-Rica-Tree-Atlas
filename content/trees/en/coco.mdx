# Coco (Coconut Palm)

<Callout type="success" title="The Tree of Life">
  **Coco** (_Cocos nucifera_) is often called the "Tree of Life" because every
  part of the palm can be used. Along Costa Rica's beautiful coastlines, coconut
  palms define the tropical landscape and provide essential resources to coastal
  communities.

<AccordionItem title="🔬 Taxonomic Notes">

_Cocos_ is a monotypic genus—meaning the coconut palm is the only species in its genus. The species epithet _nucifera_ means "nut-bearing."

**Etymology of "Coco"**: Portuguese explorers named it "coco" from the word for "grinning face" or "skull" because the three indentations on the coconut shell resemble a face.

**Varieties**: Two main forms exist:

- **Tall variety** — Traditional, 50-60 year lifespan, 15-20 m tall
- **Dwarf variety** — Smaller, earlier fruiting, shorter-lived
