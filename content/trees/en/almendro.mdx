# Almendro

<Callout type="warning" title="Guardián de la Lapa Verde">
  The **Almendro** (_Dipteryx panamensis_), also known as Almendro Amarillo or
  Tonka Bean Tree, is one of Central America's most magnificent and
  conservation-critical trees. Rising 40-60 meters above the rainforest canopy,
  it provides irreplaceable nesting cavities and food for the **endangered Great
  Green Macaw** (_Ara ambiguus_), whose survival is directly tied to this
  species.

## Ecological Significance

### The Great Green Macaw Connection

<Callout type="warning" title="Critical Species Relationship">
  The Almendro is **essential to the survival** of the Great Green Macaw (_Ara
  ambiguus_), one of the world's most endangered parrots. Macaws depend on
  Almendros for **70-80% of their diet** during nesting season and require the
  large natural cavities that only ancient Almendros provide for nesting. The
  loss of Almendros directly threatens macaw extinction.
</Callout>

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### For Great Green Macaws

- **Food Source**: Seeds are primary diet (Dec-Mar)
- **Nesting Sites**: Natural cavities in trunks/branches
- **Cavity Requirements**: Only trees 100+ years old
- **Territory Anchor**: Pairs defend Almendro groves
- **Population Link**: Macaw numbers track Almendro availability

</Column>
<Column>

#### For Other Wildlife

- **Toucans**: Feed on fruits and nest in cavities
- **Bats**: Fruit bats disperse seeds
- **Tapirs**: Eat fallen fruits
- **Agoutis**: Cache and disperse seeds
- **Epiphytes**: Massive branches host gardens of orchids and bromeliads

<Callout type="warning" title="Logging Ban">
  In 2008, Costa Rica became the first country to **legally ban all cutting of
  Almendro trees** (Decree 35340-MINAET), recognizing the species' critical
  importance to the endangered Great Green Macaw. Violations carry significant
  fines and potential imprisonment.
</Callout>

### Threats & Challenges

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Primary Threats

- **Historical Logging**: Valuable timber decimated populations
- **Deforestation**: Agricultural expansion continues
- **Fragmentation**: Isolated trees cannot support macaws
- **Slow Regeneration**: Takes 80-100 years for nesting cavities
- **Climate Change**: Shifting rainfall patterns

</Column>
<Column>

#### Conservation Actions

- **Legal Protection**: Complete logging ban in Costa Rica
- **Corridor Creation**: San Juan-La Selva Biological Corridor
- **Private Reserves**: Payment for ecosystem services
- **Community Programs**: Local macaw conservation groups
- **Research**: Monitoring populations and regeneration

## Cultural & Economic Importance

### Traditional Uses

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Indigenous Knowledge">
    The Bribri, Cabécar, and Miskito peoples have long recognized the Almendro's
    importance: - **Ñö (Bribri)**: Revered as a "grandfather tree" of the forest
    - **Food Source**: Seeds traditionally consumed after processing -
    **Medicine**: Bark preparations for various ailments - **Spiritual**:
    Associated with forest spirits and protection - **Navigation**: Used as
    landmark trees in the forest
  </AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Timber History">
  Before protection, Almendro wood was highly prized: - **Density**: One of the
  hardest woods in Central America - **Durability**: Exceptional rot resistance
  - **Uses**: Heavy construction, railroad ties, flooring - **Value**: Premium
  prices drove overexploitation - **Legacy**: Many old-growth trees were
  selectively removed
</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Tonka Beans">
    The seeds contain **coumarin**, the compound that gives tonka beans their
    distinctive vanilla-like aroma: - **Fragrance Industry**: Used in perfumery
    (limited now) - **Food Flavoring**: Traditional use (restricted due to
    coumarin content) - **Traditional Medicine**: Various folk remedies -
    **Note**: Commercial harvest not significant for this species
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

### Modern Value

<FeatureBox title="Living Value vs. Timber Value" icon="🌳">
  Studies have shown that a **living Almendro tree** provides far more economic
  value through ecosystem services, ecotourism, and biodiversity conservation
  than it would as timber. A single large Almendro supporting Great Green Macaws
  can generate thousands of dollars annually in birdwatching tourism while
  storing tons of carbon and anchoring entire forest ecosystems.

  The Almendro represents one of conservation's most compelling stories: a
  magnificent ancient tree whose fate is inseparably linked to one of the
  world's rarest parrots. Saving the Almendro means saving the Great Green
  Macaw, and saving both means preserving the irreplaceable rainforests of the
