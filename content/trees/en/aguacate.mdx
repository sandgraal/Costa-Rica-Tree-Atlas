# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "low"
toxicParts:
  - "leaves"
  - "bark"
  - "pit"
skinContactRisk: "low"
allergenRisk: "low"
structuralRisks: []
childSafe: true
petSafe: false
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "The fruit flesh is safe and highly nutritious for humans. However, leaves, bark, and pit contain persin, a fungicidal toxin that is HIGHLY TOXIC to many animals including horses, goats, cattle, rabbits, birds, and fish. Dogs and cats are moderately sensitive - large amounts can cause vomiting and diarrhea. The pit is a choking hazard and contains persin. Fruit skin may contain small amounts of persin. For humans, the fruit is safe - persin toxicity is primarily an animal concern."
skinContactDetails: "Minimal risk for humans. Some individuals may experience mild skin irritation from handling leaves or sap. The latex from damaged bark can cause minor irritation in sensitive people. Avocado fruit rarely causes contact dermatitis. Most people handle avocados and trees without issues."
allergenDetails: "Avocado allergy affects approximately 1-2% of population. People with latex allergy may have cross-reactivity (latex-fruit syndrome). Also cross-reacts with banana, kiwi, chestnut. Oral allergy syndrome can occur in people with birch pollen allergy. Reactions range from mild oral itching to serious symptoms. Avocado oil in cosmetics can cause allergic contact dermatitis in sensitized individuals."
safetyNotes: "FRUIT IS SAFE AND HEALTHY for humans. Children can safely eat avocado - it's an excellent first food for babies. KEEP AWAY FROM PETS: Never feed avocado (any part) to dogs, cats, birds, horses, rabbits, or other animals. The pit is a choking hazard for both children and pets. Dispose of pits, leaves, and prunings where animals cannot access them. Compost avocado waste only in secure bins. If you have livestock or pets that graze, fence avocado trees or keep animals away. If an animal ingests avocado plant material, contact a veterinarian immediately - symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, respiratory distress, and heart damage."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "moderate"
growthRateDetails: "Moderate growth; 0.5-1 m/year depending on variety and conditions; grafted trees bear fruit in 3-4 years, seedlings 5-13 years; reaches mature size (12-15m) in 10-15 years"
matureSize: "10-20 m tall (commercial varieties typically pruned to 6-8m), crown spread 8-12 m; can grow larger if unpruned"
hardiness: "Tropical to subtropical; Costa Rica elevation 0-2500m depending on variety; lowland varieties (West Indian) 0-800m, highland varieties (Guatemalan, Mexican) 800-2500m"
soilRequirements: "CRITICAL: Well-drained soil essential - avocado is highly susceptible to root rot. Prefers sandy loam or volcanic soils; pH 6.0-7.0; does NOT tolerate waterlogged or heavy clay soils; benefits from organic mulch"
waterNeeds: "moderate"
waterDetails: "Moderate water needs but VERY sensitive to both drought and overwatering. Young trees need regular watering (2-3 times/week) but soil must drain completely between waterings. Mature trees are somewhat drought-tolerant but produce best with consistent moisture. Reduce watering during cool/rainy periods to prevent root rot. Drip irrigation ideal."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plant 6-10 m from buildings and other trees; some varieties need cross-pollination so plant 2+ trees within 15m for better fruiting"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
  - "grafting"
  - "air layering"
propagationDifficulty: "moderate"
plantingSeason: "Plant in rainy season (May-June) for best establishment; can plant year-round with irrigation; spring planting preferred in highlands"
maintenanceNeeds: "MODERATE to HIGH maintenance fruit tree. Years 1-2: weekly watering critical, stake young tree, protect from wind, apply balanced fertilizer quarterly. Years 3-5: prune to shape and control height (remove vertical shoots, open center for light), thin fruit if heavy set, continue fertilization. Mature trees: annual pruning to maintain height (6-8m manageable for harvest), remove dead wood, monitor for diseases (anthracnose, root rot). MULCH heavily but keep away from trunk. Thin fruit to prevent branch breakage. Most varieties benefit from companion pollinator tree."
commonProblems:
  - "ROOT ROT (Phytophthora) - #1 killer of avocados - ensure perfect drainage, avoid overwatering"
  - "Anthracnose fungal disease on fruit/leaves - worse in wet conditions, needs fungicide treatment"
  - "Sunburn on trunk of young trees - protect with trunk wraps or shade until canopy develops"
  - "Alternate bearing (heavy crop one year, light the next) - thin fruit in heavy years"
  - "Fruit drop before maturity - normal to drop 95% of flowers/small fruit"
  - "Wind damage - brittle wood, stake young trees, site selection important in windy areas"
  - "Pest: Avocado seed moth, thrips, scale insects - monitor and treat as needed"
  - "PET TOXICITY - secure area from dogs, cats, birds, horses accessing fallen leaves/fruit"

# Aguacate (Avocado)

<Callout type="success" title="Ancient Mesoamerican Treasure">
  **Aguacate** (_Persea americana_) has been cultivated for over 5,000 years in
  Central America. The name comes from the Nahuatl word "ahuacatl," and this
  nutritious fruit tree remains a cornerstone of Costa Rican cuisine and
  agriculture.
