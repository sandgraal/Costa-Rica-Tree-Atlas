# Nazareno

<Callout type="warning" title="The Purple Treasure">
  The **Nazareno** (_Peltogyne purpurea_), known internationally as
  **Purpleheart**, produces one of the world's most extraordinary timbers: wood
  that turns a vivid, saturated purple when exposed to light and air. This
  magnificent emergent tree of Costa Rica's old-growth rainforests has been
  heavily exploited for its valuable timber and is now considered **Vulnerable**
  by conservation assessments. The Nazareno represents both the incredible
  botanical richness of Neotropical forests and the urgent need to protect what
  remains. Finding a standing Nazareno in the wild is becoming increasingly
  rare—a sobering reminder that beauty can be a species' curse when humans covet
  it.

## Physical Description

### Overall Form

The Nazareno is a large canopy emergent tree with a tall, straight trunk and a spreading crown that reaches above the surrounding forest. Mature trees develop impressive buttresses at the base. The trunk is cylindrical and can grow remarkably straight—one of the reasons the timber is so valuable.

### Distinguishing Features

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Leaves

- **Type**: Compound, bifoliate (2 leaflets!)
- **Leaflets**: Distinctive paired, asymmetrical
- **Size**: 5-12 cm each leaflet
- **Texture**: Leathery, glossy
- **Unique**: Two-leaflet compound leaf is diagnostic

#### Bark

- **Color**: Gray to reddish-brown
- **Texture**: Rough, somewhat scaly
- **Inner bark**: Reddish

</Column>
<Column>

#### The Legendary Wood

- **Fresh cut**: Brown-gray initially
- **Exposed**: Turns vivid PURPLE
- **Mechanism**: Oxidation of extractives
- **Final color**: Deep purple-violet
- **Density**: Very heavy (900-1100 kg/m³)
- **Durability**: Extremely resistant

#### Flowers and Fruit

- **Flowers**: Small, white, in panicles
- **Fruit**: Flat pod, single-seeded
- **Pod size**: 3-5 cm
- **Seed**: Flat, hard

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

<Callout type="tip" title="The Purple Transformation">
  The purple color of Nazareno wood is a remarkable phenomenon: **How It
  Happens**: 1. Freshly cut heartwood is dull grayish-brown 2. Exposure to light
  and air begins oxidation 3. Extractive compounds undergo chemical change 4.
  Color shifts to vivid purple within hours to days 5. Maximum purple intensity
  reached **Color Stability**: - Intense purple initially - Slowly darkens over
  years - Eventually becomes deep brownish-purple - UV finishes can slow this
  process **The Compounds**: Pterostilbenes and related compounds create the
  color. These also make the wood extremely rot-resistant.

</FeatureBox>

### Market and Conservation Tension

<Callout type="warning" title="The Cost of Beauty">
  The very qualities that make Nazareno valuable have led to its decline:
  **Market Factors**: - High demand for exotic hardwoods - Premium prices
  internationally - Illegal logging pressure - Slow regeneration **The
  Problem**: - Large trees are targeted first - Best genetics removed from
  population - Long time to maturity (80+ years) - Regeneration difficult
  **Current Status**: - Legally protected in Costa Rica - Listed as Vulnerable
  (IUCN) - Wild populations declining - Plantation trials ongoing Every piece of
  purpleheart carries an ecological cost.

## Cultivation and Restoration

### Growing Nazareno

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Why Cultivation Is Important">
    **Conservation Rationale**: - Reduce pressure on wild populations - Preserve
    genetic diversity - Sustainable timber alternative - Reforestation tool
    **Challenges**: - Very slow growth - Long time to timber size - Specific
    habitat requirements - Limited seed availability
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Propagation">
    **From Seed**: - Collect from mature trees - Fresh seed germinates best -
    Germination in 2-4 weeks - Seedlings need shade initially **Nursery Care**:
    - Partial shade for seedlings - Regular watering - Transplant at 30-50 cm
    height - Protect from full sun initially
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Plantation Considerations">
    **Site Requirements**: - Wet tropical climate only - Good drainage - Rich
    soil preferred - Protection from wind **Reality**: - 80+ years to commercial
    timber - Not economically viable for quick return - Valuable for restoration
    - May work in mixed agroforestry

## Identification Guide

### How to Identify Nazareno

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Key Identification Features">
    **Diagnostic Feature:** The **bifoliate compound leaf** (two leaflets only)
    is nearly diagnostic. Few other large trees have this leaf type. **Other
    Identifiers:** 1. Large emergent tree 2. Buttressed base 3. Gray-brown rough
    bark 4. Two-leaflet compound leaves (key!) 5. Small white flowers in
    panicles **If Cut (illegal to do!)**: - Heartwood turns purple on exposure
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Similar Species">
    | Species | Difference | |---------|------------| | _Hymenaea courbaril_
    (Guapinol) | Leaflets similar but bark, fruit different | | Other
    _Peltogyne_ species | Geographic range, minor differences | The two-leaflet
    compound leaf combined with the habitat and tree form make Nazareno
    relatively distinctive.

  ]}
/>

<Callout type="tip" title="Finding Nazareno">
  Seeing a wild Nazareno requires effort: **Best Approach**: - Visit Corcovado
  National Park - Hire a knowledgeable guide - Multi-day trek increases chances
  - Sirena station area has good forest **What to Look For**: - Large emergent
  trees - Distinctive two-leaflet leaves - Ask guides to identify **Ethical
  Considerations**: - Never reveal locations publicly (poaching risk) - Support
  conservation efforts - Report any logging activity Finding a big Nazareno in
  the wild is increasingly rare— treasure the experience if you do.

<Callout type="success" title="A Purple Warning">
  The Nazareno stands as both marvel and cautionary tale. Here is a tree that
  performs biological alchemy—transforming mundane brown wood into vivid purple
  through nothing but exposure to air, a trick of chemistry that has captivated
  humans for centuries. That remarkable purple has been the tree's glory and its
  curse. Because we wanted that color—for our furniture, our floors, our
  decorative objects—we hunted the Nazareno across its range, taking the biggest
  and best until what remains are fragments of what once was. Today, finding a
  large Nazareno in the wild requires journeying to Costa Rica's most remote
  forests and even there, the logger's chainsaw has left its mark. The Nazareno
  teaches us that biological wonder comes with responsibility. We can admire the
  purple wood—but we must also ask at what cost it came, and what we're willing
  to do to ensure that future generations can walk through a forest and look up
  at a living Nazareno, not just down at a purple floor.
