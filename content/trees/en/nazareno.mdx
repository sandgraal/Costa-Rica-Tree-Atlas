# Nazareno

<Callout type="warning" title="The Purple Treasure">
  The **Nazareno** (_Peltogyne purpurea_), known internationally as
  **Purpleheart**, produces one of the world's most extraordinary timbers: wood
  that turns a vivid, saturated purple when exposed to light and air. This
  magnificent emergent tree of Costa Rica's old-growth rainforests has been
  heavily exploited for its valuable timber and is now considered **Vulnerable**
  by conservation assessments. The Nazareno represents both the incredible
  botanical richness of Neotropical forests and the urgent need to protect what
  remains. Finding a standing Nazareno in the wild is becoming increasingly
  rare—a sobering reminder that beauty can be a species' curse when humans covet
  it.

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

<Callout type="tip" title="The Purple Transformation">
  The purple color of Nazareno wood is a remarkable phenomenon: **How It
  Happens**: 1. Freshly cut heartwood is dull grayish-brown 2. Exposure to light
  and air begins oxidation 3. Extractive compounds undergo chemical change 4.
  Color shifts to vivid purple within hours to days 5. Maximum purple intensity
  reached **Color Stability**: - Intense purple initially - Slowly darkens over
  years - Eventually becomes deep brownish-purple - UV finishes can slow this
  process **The Compounds**: Pterostilbenes and related compounds create the
  color. These also make the wood extremely rot-resistant.

## Ecological Role

### In the Forest Ecosystem

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Structural Role

- **Canopy emergent**: Creates forest structure
- **Seed producer**: Food for wildlife
- **Nitrogen fixation**: As legume, enriches soil
- **Habitat**: Large tree supports many species
- **Carbon storage**: Massive trunk stores significant carbon
- **Microhabitat creation**: Buttresses shelter small animals

</Column>
<Column>

#### Wildlife Interactions

- **Seed dispersal**: Agoutis, other rodents
- **Canopy habitat**: Birds, monkeys
- **Insect community**: Host tree
- **Cavity nesting**: Old trees provide homes
- **Epiphyte support**: Branches support orchids and bromeliads
- **Pollination**: Small insects, possibly bees

  ]}
/>

### Nitrogen Fixation: The Legume Advantage

As a member of the Fabaceae (legume family), the Nazareno has a remarkable ability that many large tropical trees lack: **nitrogen fixation**. Through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria in root nodules, the tree converts atmospheric nitrogen into forms usable by plants. This enriches the surrounding soil and benefits neighboring trees and understory plants—making the Nazareno not just a timber species but a **keystone nutrient provider** in its forest ecosystem.

<Callout type="info" title="Ecological Engineer">
  A single large Nazareno can fix an estimated **20-50 kg of nitrogen per
  year**, enriching the soil in a radius of up to 15 meters around its base.
  When these trees are selectively logged, the nutrient cycling of the entire
  forest patch is disrupted—an often-overlooked consequence of timber
  extraction.
</Callout>

## Cultural and Historical Significance

### The Purple Robes Connection

The name "Nazareno" comes directly from the Nazarene tradition in Catholic Costa Rica. During **Semana Santa** (Holy Week) processions, religious brotherhoods wear **tunics of deep purple**—the same vivid hue as the tree's heartwood. The connection was so striking to colonial-era settlers that they named the tree after these penitents. The purple of Nazareno wood thus carries layers of meaning: spiritual devotion, sacrifice, and the beauty found in suffering.

### Indigenous Heritage

The Bribri and Cabécar peoples of the Talamanca region have known this tree for centuries, long before Spanish colonization:

<SimpleList
  items={[
    "Used the durable wood for construction of ceremonial structures",
    "Bark extracts used in traditional medicine for treating wounds",
    "The tree held spiritual significance as a guardian of the forest",
    "Purple pigment from heartwood used to dye ceremonial textiles",
    "Considered a marker of healthy, old-growth forest — its presence indicated undisturbed land",
  ]}
/>

### Logging History

<Callout type="warning" title="A Cautionary History">
  The logging history of Nazareno in Costa Rica mirrors the broader tragedy of tropical hardwood extraction:

- **Pre-1950s**: Abundant throughout lowland Atlantic and Pacific rainforests
- **1950s-1970s**: Road-building opened remote forests; intensive logging began
- **1970s-1990s**: Peak exploitation; largest and oldest trees targeted first
- **1990s-present**: Legal protections enacted but enforcement remains challenging
- **Today**: Large wild specimens are rare outside protected areas

The Osa Peninsula's forests survived largely because of their extreme remoteness—accessible only by boat or small aircraft for decades. Even so, illegal logging has penetrated these last refuges.

</Callout>

### Purpleheart in Global Culture

Nazareno wood has been prized across cultures worldwide:

- **European royalty**: Used in decorative inlays since the 18th century
- **Japanese woodworking**: Valued for its unique color in fine joinery
- **Musical instruments**: Guitar fretboards and turned drumsticks
- **Modern craft**: Popular with woodturners for bowls, pens, and artistic pieces
- **Martial arts**: Used for bokken (practice swords) due to extreme hardness

## Traditional and Medicinal Uses

### Ethnobotanical Knowledge

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Traditional Medicine">
    Indigenous communities in Central and South America have used various parts of the Nazareno medicinally:

    - **Bark decoctions**: Applied to wounds as an antiseptic wash
    - **Inner bark tea**: Used to treat diarrhea and intestinal parasites
    - **Crushed leaves**: Applied as poultices for skin infections
    - **Heartwood shavings**: Steeped in water for a tonic believed to strengthen blood

    **Note**: These are traditional uses documented in ethnobotanical literature. They are not medically validated and should not replace professional medical advice.

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Traditional Construction">
    The extraordinary durability of Nazareno wood made it invaluable for structures that needed to last generations:

    - **House posts**: Driven into the ground, they resist rot for decades
    - **Threshing floors**: The hard surface withstands heavy use
    - **Bridge supports**: Used in river crossings in remote communities
    - **Fence posts**: Outlast most other woods by 3-5 times
    - **Tool handles**: Axes, machetes, and hammers with near-unbreakable handles

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Natural Dye">
    The purple pigments in Nazareno heartwood have been used as a natural dye:

    - Heartwood shavings boiled in water produce a purple-violet dye
    - Used to color cotton and other natural fibers
    - Color is moderately lightfast but fades with prolonged sun exposure
    - Mixed with mordants (alum, iron) to achieve different purple shades
    - Still used by artisans in some communities for specialty textiles

## Identification Guide

### How to Identify Nazareno

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Key Identification Features" defaultOpen={true}>
    **Diagnostic Feature:** The **bifoliate compound leaf** (two leaflets only) is nearly diagnostic. Few other large trees have this leaf type.

    **Other Identifiers:**
    1. Large emergent tree
    2. Buttressed base
    3. Gray-brown rough bark
    4. Two-leaflet compound leaves (key!)
    5. Small white flowers in panicles

    **If Cut (illegal to do!):**
    - Heartwood turns purple on exposure

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Similar Species">
    <DataTable
      headers={["Species", "Difference"]}
      rows={[

<Callout type="success" title="A Purple Warning">
  The Nazareno stands as both marvel and cautionary tale. Here is a tree that
  performs biological alchemy—transforming mundane brown wood into vivid purple
  through nothing but exposure to air, a trick of chemistry that has captivated
  humans for centuries. That remarkable purple has been the tree's glory and its
  curse. Because we wanted that color—for our furniture, our floors, our
  decorative objects—we hunted the Nazareno across its range, taking the biggest
  and best until what remains are fragments of what once was. Today, finding a
  large Nazareno in the wild requires journeying to Costa Rica's most remote
  forests and even there, the logger's chainsaw has left its mark. The Nazareno
  teaches us that biological wonder comes with responsibility. We can admire the
  purple wood—but we must also ask at what cost it came, and what we're willing
  to do to ensure that future generations can walk through a forest and look up
  at a living Nazareno, not just down at a purple floor.
