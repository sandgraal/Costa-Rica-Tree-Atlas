# Cerillo

<Callout type="success" title="The Swamp Specialist with Red Blood">
  The **Cerillo** (_Symphonia globulifera_) is one of Costa Rica's most
  distinctive wetland trees, immediately recognizable by its stilt roots and
  brilliant red latex that bleeds when cut. Found in swamps, flooded forests,
  and along waterways, this tree has been used for centuries to make dugout
  canoes and in traditional medicine.

<AccordionItem title="🔬 Taxonomic Notes">

_Symphonia globulifera_ is remarkable for occurring naturally in both tropical America AND tropical Africa—one of the few tree species with this trans-Atlantic distribution. This suggests the species evolved before the continents separated or dispersed across the Atlantic. Clusiaceae (the mangosteen family) includes many latex-producing trees.

**Name Origin**: "Cerillo" means "little wax" or "little candle" in Spanish, possibly referring to the waxy nature of the latex.

The Cerillo's most distinctive feature is its stilt roots—aerial roots that prop up the tree like legs, an adaptation to flooded habitats. The trunk may be elevated a meter or more above the ground on these stilts.

<Callout type="success" title="The Bleeding Tree of the Swamps">

_Symphonia globulifera stands in Costa Rica's wetlands on its remarkable stilt
roots, bleeding brilliant red when wounded, flowering year-round for
hummingbirds. This ancient tree—one of the few species found on both sides
of the Atlantic—connects us to deep time while reminding us that some of
our most valuable ecosystems are the wet, "unproductive" swamps that we've
too often drained away. Where Cerillo grows, the water flows._
