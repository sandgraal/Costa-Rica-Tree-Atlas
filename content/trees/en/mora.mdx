description: "The Mora (Dyer's Mulberry or Fustic) is a historically important tree whose bright yellow heartwood was once one of the most valuable natural dyes in the world. Native from Mexico through South America, this medium-sized tree in the mulberry family produces wood that yields a brilliant golden-yellow dye that was traded across the Atlantic for centuries. In Costa Rica, the Mora grows throughout lowland forests and disturbed areas, its thorny branches and milky sap marking it as a member of the Moraceae family while its golden heartwood reveals its special nature."

# Mora (Dyer's Mulberry / Fustic)

<Callout type="success" title="The Golden Dye Tree">
  The **Mora** (_Maclura tinctoria_), known internationally as Fustic or Dyer's
  Mulberry, has a history intertwined with global trade and textile arts. For
  centuries, the brilliant yellow heartwood of this tree was one of the most
  sought-after natural dyes in the world, shipped from Central and South America
  to Europe where it colored fabrics from peasant cloth to royal robes. Though
  synthetic dyes have largely replaced it, the Mora remains an important tree
  throughout the Neotropics, providing durable wood, food for wildlife, and a
  living connection to the pre-synthetic age when trees provided the colors that
  dressed the world.

## Historical Importance: The Dye Trade

<FeatureBox title="Fustic: The Golden Dye of the Americas" icon="🎨">
  The Mora's heartwood changed the history of textiles: **The Dye**: - Produces
  brilliant golden-yellow - Can be modified to orange, olive, gold - Color-fast
  and durable - Works on wool, silk, cotton **Historical Trade**: - Exported
  from Spanish colonies 1500s onward - Major trade commodity for centuries -
  Ships carried tons of dye wood to Europe - Called "Old Fustic" to distinguish
  from other yellows **Uses**: - Textile dyeing (primary use) - With indigo:
  greens - With madder: oranges - Wood staining - Ink production **Decline**: -
  Synthetic dyes (1856 onward) reduced demand - But natural dyeing revival has
  renewed interest - Still used by artisan dyers today For centuries, the
  forests of the Americas provided the golden color that dressed much of the
  world.

## Cultivation

### Growing Mora

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Site Requirements">
    **Ideal Conditions**: - Full sun to partial shade - Well-drained soils -
    Tropical lowland climate - Tolerates seasonal drought **Soil Preferences**:
    - Very adaptable - Tolerates poor soils - Good drainage preferred - pH
    flexible
  </AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Propagation">
  **From Seed** (most common): - Extract from ripe fruit - Clean and dry seeds -
  Sow fresh for best germination - Germination: 2-4 weeks **From Cuttings**: -
  Large hardwood cuttings - Can establish from stakes - Used for living fences
  **Growth Rate**: - Fast when young - Slows with maturity - First flowers: 3-5
  years
</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Management">
    **Considerations**: - THORNY: Plant away from paths - Spreads readily (can
    be weedy) - Prune for access if needed - Wildlife will spread seeds **As
    Living Fence**: - Plant large stakes close together - Will root and form
    barrier - Thorns deter livestock - May need periodic trimming

  Mora is common but often overlooked: **Where to Look**: - Forest edges and
  clearings - Old pastures - Living fence rows - Secondary growth areas **How to
  Confirm**: - Look for thorny branches - Check for milky latex - If possible,
  see heartwood (yellow) - Lumpy round fruits when present **Best Viewing**: -
  Dry season: May see yellow fall color - Fruiting: Attracts wildlife - Any
  time: Yellow heartwood diagnostic Ask locals about "Mora" - it's well-known as
  a dye and fence tree throughout Central America.

<Callout type="success" title="Gold from the Forest">
  Before synthetic chemistry transformed the world, the colors that adorned
  humanity came from nature—from plants, insects, minerals, and shells. The Mora
  was one of the great color-givers, its golden heartwood sailing across oceans
  in the holds of ships to color the textiles of Europe. Today, those trade
  routes are forgotten, the synthetic aniline dyes have conquered the market,
  and the Mora stands quietly in the forests and field edges of Central America,
  largely unaware of its illustrious past. But cut into a branch and the gold is
  still there—brilliant, unmistakable, a reminder that trees once dressed the
  world. For natural dyers keeping the old arts alive, for curious naturalists
  wanting to understand history, for anyone who has wondered where colors came
  from before chemistry, the Mora stands ready to share its gift. Its thorny
  branches guard that golden heart, but the color within has been freely given
  for centuries, painting the world in shades of sun.
