description: "The Mora (Dyer's Mulberry or Fustic) is a historically important tree whose bright yellow heartwood was once one of the most valuable natural dyes in the world. Native from Mexico through South America, this medium-sized tree in the mulberry family produces wood that yields a brilliant golden-yellow dye that was traded across the Atlantic for centuries. In Costa Rica, the Mora grows throughout lowland forests and disturbed areas, its thorny branches and milky sap marking it as a member of the Moraceae family while its golden heartwood reveals its special nature."

  - "sap"
skinContactRisk: "low"
allergenRisk: "low"
childSafe: true
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "Low toxicity. Member of Moraceae family (mulberry/fig), which often have milky latex. Fruits are technically edible but not palatable—small and dry. Sap may contain mild irritants. Tree is not considered dangerously toxic. However, some Moraceae species can cause reactions in latex-sensitive individuals."
skinContactDetails: "Milky sap can cause mild skin irritation in some people, similar to other Moraceae family members. Generally safe to handle but wash hands after contact with sap. Branches have thorns which pose physical injury risk."
allergenDetails: "Low allergen risk. May cause mild reactions in individuals allergic to latex or other Moraceae family members (figs, mulberries). Not a significant allergen."
safetyNotes: "Generally safe for landscaping with minor considerations. Main physical hazard is thorny branches—avoid planting near paths or play areas. Sap may cause mild irritation. Not toxic enough to avoid planting in residential areas. However, fruits are not particularly palatable and not typically eaten by humans. Can be used in living fences."
wildlifeRisks: "Safe for wildlife. Fruits are eaten by birds and small mammals despite being dry and small. Not known to be toxic to pets or livestock."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "moderate"
growthRateDetails: "Moderate growth; 0.6-1 m/year in good conditions; reaches 8-10 m in 10-15 years; achieves mature size (20-25 m) in 25-35 years; faster in disturbed areas and full sun"
matureSize: "20-30 m tall, trunk diameter 40-80 cm; irregular spreading crown 12-18 m wide; can be maintained smaller through pruning for living fences"
hardiness: "Tropical lowlands to dry forests; Costa Rica elevation 0-1000m; thrives in hot dry climates; tolerates heat to 40°C; requires pronounced dry season for best growth; no frost tolerance"
soilRequirements: "Very adaptable; tolerates poor, degraded, rocky soils; prefers well-drained soils; pH 6.0-7.5; grows on hillsides, pastures, disturbed areas; does NOT tolerate waterlogged conditions; thrives in dry forest conditions"
waterNeeds: "low"
waterDetails: "LOW water needs - excellent drought tolerance. Young trees (years 1-2) need weekly watering during dry season. Mature trees are HIGHLY DROUGHT-TOLERANT and thrive with natural rainfall in dry forest zones (1200-2000 mm annual). Can survive 4-6 month dry seasons. Prefers areas with distinct dry season. Water only during establishment."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plant 6-8 m from buildings (thorns); 4-6 m spacing for living fences; 8-10 m for specimen trees; thorny branches require distance from paths"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
  - "cuttings"
propagationDifficulty: "easy"
plantingSeason: "Plant at start of rainy season (May-June); cuttings root easily for living fences; can also plant during rainy season (July-October)"
maintenanceNeeds: "VERY LOW maintenance - one of easiest native trees. Years 1-2: water weekly during dry season, weed around base, protect from livestock (thorns help naturally). Years 3-5: essentially maintenance-free, prune only for shape or living fence management. Mature trees: no maintenance required except occasional pruning for fences. Handles neglect well. Perfect for low-input systems, living fences, dry areas, reforestation. CAUTION: Thorny branches require care during pruning - use thick gloves and protective clothing."
commonProblems:
  - "THORNY BRANCHES - primary safety concern during maintenance"
  - "Not suitable near paths or play areas due to thorns"
  - "Fruits attract wildlife but are not edible for humans"
  - "Milky sap may cause mild skin irritation - wash after contact"
  - "Can spread in disturbed areas - may become weedy"
  - "Few pest/disease problems - very resilient"
  - "Wood is valuable (golden dye) - potential theft of mature trees"
  - "Surface roots in some conditions - avoid planting near foundations"

# Mora (Dyer's Mulberry / Fustic)

<Callout type="success" title="The Golden Dye Tree">
  The **Mora** (_Maclura tinctoria_), known internationally as Fustic or Dyer's
  Mulberry, has a history intertwined with global trade and textile arts. For
  centuries, the brilliant yellow heartwood of this tree was one of the most
  sought-after natural dyes in the world, shipped from Central and South America
  to Europe where it colored fabrics from peasant cloth to royal robes. Though
  synthetic dyes have largely replaced it, the Mora remains an important tree
  throughout the Neotropics, providing durable wood, food for wildlife, and a
  living connection to the pre-synthetic age when trees provided the colors that
  dressed the world.

    **Ideal Conditions**: - Full sun to partial shade - Well-drained soils -
    Tropical lowland climate - Tolerates seasonal drought **Soil Preferences**:
    - Very adaptable - Tolerates poor soils - Good drainage preferred - pH
    flexible
  </AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Propagation">
  **From Seed** (most common): - Extract from ripe fruit - Clean and dry seeds -
  Sow fresh for best germination - Germination: 2-4 weeks **From Cuttings**: -
  Large hardwood cuttings - Can establish from stakes - Used for living fences
  **Growth Rate**: - Fast when young - Slows with maturity - First flowers: 3-5
  years
</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Management & Care">
    **Watering Requirements**:
    - **Young trees (0-2 years)**: Water 2-3 times weekly during establishment
    - **Mature trees**: Highly drought-tolerant once established
    - Dry season: Minimal supplemental watering needed (monthly deep soak)
    - Rainy season: Natural rainfall sufficient
    - Very adaptable to seasonal water availability
    - One of the most water-efficient fruit trees for lowland tropics

    **Fertilization Schedule**:
    - **Year 1-2**: Light application of 10-10-10 NPK every 3-4 months (100-150g)
    - **Year 3+**: Fertilize 2-3 times yearly with balanced fertilizer (200-300g)
    - Not a heavy feeder—tolerates poor soil fertility
    - Can thrive without fertilization in moderately fertile soils
    - Compost mulch annually beneficial but not essential
    - **Note**: Mora's low nutrient requirements make it ideal for marginal lands

    **Pruning Guidelines**:
    - **Caution**: Tree has significant thorns—wear heavy gloves and protective clothing
    - **Young tree training (Years 1-3)**: Minimal shaping; allow natural spreading form
    - **Maintenance pruning**: Remove dead, diseased branches and crossing limbs
    - **Access pruning**: Prune lower thorny branches away from paths and work areas
    - **Height control**: Can be topped at 4-5m for easier fruit harvest
    - **Living fence maintenance**: Trim regularly to maintain desired height/density
    - Best time: Late dry season before new growth flush
    - IMPORTANT: Use long-handled pruners to maintain safe distance from thorns

    **Pest & Disease Management**:
    - **Generally pest-resistant**: Few serious problems
    - **Fruit flies**: May affect ripening fruit—harvest promptly when ripe
    - **Scale insects**: Occasional issue—monitor and treat if necessary
    - Very tolerant of environmental stress
    - Hardy and low-maintenance compared to most fruit trees
    - Good sanitation: Remove fallen fruit to avoid attracting pests

    **Harvest Guidelines**:
    - Fruit ready when color develops (varies by type: yellow, purple, or red)
    - Harvest when fruit softens slightly and detaches easily
    - Use long pole with basket to avoid thorns on branches
    - Wear gloves when handling branches
    - Process fruit quickly—highly perishable (1-3 days)
    - Peak season varies by location: typically rainy season
    - Yields increase with tree age: 20-100+ kg per mature tree

    **Safety Considerations**:
    - **THORNY**: Plant away from paths, playgrounds, and high-traffic areas
    - **Spreading habit**: Can become weedy—control seedling volunteers
    - Not recommended for small urban yards with children/pets
    - Excellent for rural properties, living fences, and wildlife areas

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Companion Planting">
    **Beneficial Companions**:
    - **Nitrogen-fixing trees (legenón, madero negro)**: Improve soil for this low-demand species
    - **Pasture grasses**: Compatible as scattered shade tree in silvopasture systems
    - **Pioneer species**: Integrates well in reforestation projects
    - **Deep-rooted crops**: Mora's moderate root system doesn't compete heavily

    **Compatible Lowland Trees**:
    - Other tough, drought-tolerant species:
      - Guanacaste (Enterolobium)
      - Cortez amarillo (Tabebuia)
      - Guacimo (Guazuma)
      - Jocote (Spondias)

    **Plants to Avoid**:
    - Shallow-rooted ornamentals sensitive to root competition
    - Plants requiring full sun—mora can cast moderate shade
    - Any plants in high-traffic areas near thorny branches

    **Agroforestry Applications**:
    - **Living fences**: Plant large stakes 1-2m apart; roots readily
    - **Silvopasture**: Scattered trees provide shade; thorns protect trunk from livestock
    - **Windbreaks**: Dense thorny growth provides excellent barrier
    - **Wildlife corridors**: Fruit attracts diverse fauna
    - **Erosion control**: Spreading roots stabilize slopes

    **Traditional Uses**:
    - Fence posts (stakes root to form living fence)
    - Property boundaries (thorns deter trespassing)
    - Cattle deterrent (spiny barrier)
    - Wildlife habitat tree

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Year-Round Care (Lowland Tropics)">
    **December-April (Dry Season)**:
    - Minimal care required—drought-tolerant
    - Optional monthly deep watering for young trees
    - Monitor for scale insects in dry conditions
    - Good time for access pruning (tree dormant)

    **May-June (Early Rainy Season)**:
    - New growth flush begins
    - Flowering typically starts
    - Apply annual fertilization if desired (not essential)
    - Check living fences—trim if becoming overgrown

    **July-October (Rainy Season/Fruiting)**:
    - Main fruiting period (varies by location)
    - Harvest regularly as fruit ripens
    - Process fruit immediately—doesn't store well
    - Wildlife very active—may compete for fruit

    **November (Transition)**:
    - Late-season fruit harvest
    - Clean up fallen fruit and debris
    - Assess tree health before dry season
    - Plan any major pruning for late dry season

    **Note**: Mora is exceptionally low-maintenance. Once established, survives with minimal intervention—one of the easiest fruiting trees for dry tropical lowlands.

<Callout type="success" title="Gold from the Forest">
  Before synthetic chemistry transformed the world, the colors that adorned
  humanity came from nature—from plants, insects, minerals, and shells. The Mora
  was one of the great color-givers, its golden heartwood sailing across oceans
  in the holds of ships to color the textiles of Europe. Today, those trade
  routes are forgotten, the synthetic aniline dyes have conquered the market,
  and the Mora stands quietly in the forests and field edges of Central America,
  largely unaware of its illustrious past. But cut into a branch and the gold is
  still there—brilliant, unmistakable, a reminder that trees once dressed the
  world. For natural dyers keeping the old arts alive, for curious naturalists
  wanting to understand history, for anyone who has wondered where colors came
  from before chemistry, the Mora stands ready to share its gift. Its thorny
  branches guard that golden heart, but the color within has been freely given
  for centuries, painting the world in shades of sun.
