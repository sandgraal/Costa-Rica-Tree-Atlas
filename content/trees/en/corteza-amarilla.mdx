# Corteza Amarilla

<Callout type="tip" title="Golden Herald of the Dry Season">
  **Corteza Amarilla** (_Handroanthus ochraceus_), also known as Yellow Cortez
  or Golden Trumpet Tree, transforms Costa Rica's dry season landscapes into
  seas of brilliant yellow. When most trees are dormant and leafless, this
  species erupts in spectacular bloom, making it one of the country's most
  beloved and recognizable native trees.

## Ecological Significance

### Dry Season Resource

<Callout type="success" title="Critical Pollinator Resource">
  The Corteza Amarilla blooms during the driest months when few other trees
  flower, making it a **critical nectar and pollen source** for bees,
  butterflies, and hummingbirds. A single tree can support thousands of
  pollinator visits during its peak bloom period.
</Callout>

### Wildlife Interactions

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Pollinators

The flowers attract diverse pollinators:

- **Native Bees**: Carpenter bees, stingless bees (Meliponini)
- **Honeybees**: Important managed and feral populations
- **Hummingbirds**: Cinnamon, Rufous-tailed, and others
- **Butterflies**: Sulfurs, swallowtails, and skippers
- **Moths**: Nocturnal visitors for late-blooming flowers

</Column>
<Column>

#### Other Wildlife

- **Orioles**: Baltimore and other species visit flowers
- **Parakeets**: Feed on developing seeds
- **Iguanas**: Rest in branches, occasional flower consumption
- **Epiphytes**: Branches support orchids and bromeliads

### Apiculture

<Callout type="info" title="Honey Production">
  Corteza Amarilla is one of the most important **honey-producing trees** in
  Central America. The abundant nectar during the dry season produces a
  light-colored, delicately flavored honey prized by beekeepers. In Costa Rica,
  this "miel de corteza" commands premium prices.

## Cultivation & Propagation

### Growing Corteza Amarilla

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Propagation Methods

**From Seeds (Primary Method)**

1. Collect seeds from mature pods (April-June)
2. Sow fresh—viability decreases rapidly
3. Plant in well-draining nursery mix
4. Light coverage (seeds need some light)
5. Keep moist; germination in 10-20 days
6. Transplant when 20-30 cm tall

**From Cuttings**

1. Semi-hardwood cuttings in rainy season
2. Rooting hormone recommended
3. Success rate lower than seeds (40-60%)
4. Takes 2-3 months to establish

</Column>
<Column>

#### Growing Conditions

<SimpleList
  items={[
    "Sun: Full sun essential for flowering",
    "Soil: Well-drained, pH 5.5-7.5",
    "Water: Moderate; drought-tolerant when established",
    "Elevation: Best below 1,200 m",
    "Spacing: 8-10 m for ornamental plantings",
    "First Bloom: 4-8 years from seed",
  ]}
/>

#### Care Tips

- **Pruning**: Minimal; shape when young if desired
- **Fertilizer**: Low nitrogen to promote flowering
- **Watering**: Deep, infrequent once established
- **Pests**: Generally pest-resistant
- **Site Selection**: Avoid waterlogged areas

    foliage, pods maturing and releasing winged seeds **Late Wet Season
    (December):** Leaves beginning to yellow and fall

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Places to See Corteza Amarilla">
  For the most spectacular displays of blooming Corteza Amarilla, visit
  **Guanacaste Province** between February and April. Santa Rosa National Park,
  Rincón de la Vieja, and the roads around Liberia offer stunning views. In the
  Central Valley, look for them along the road to Atenas and throughout the
  western suburbs of San José. Timing varies by a few weeks depending on
  rainfall patterns, so check local reports for peak bloom.
