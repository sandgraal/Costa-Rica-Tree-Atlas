# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "none"
toxicParts: []
skinContactRisk: "none"
allergenRisk: "none"
structuralRisks: []
childSafe: true
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "Nance fruit is completely safe and nutritious. No toxic parts. The fruit has been safely consumed for thousands of years throughout its range. Safe for children and pets. The fruit is rich in vitamin C and other nutrients. No toxicity concerns whatsoever."
skinContactDetails: "No skin hazards. The tree, leaves, bark, and fruit do not cause skin irritation. Safe to handle in all situations."
allergenDetails: "Nance allergy is extremely rare to nonexistent in documented literature. No known cross-reactivity issues. The fruit and tree are generally safe for everyone. One of the safest tropical fruit trees."
safetyNotes: "COMPLETELY SAFE. Nance is one of the safest fruit trees you can plant. Children can eat the fruit freely. The only 'danger' is the polarizing flavor - people either love it or find it too strong! But there are zero safety concerns. An excellent choice for family gardens, schools, and public areas. The fruit is traditionally eaten fresh, preserved in syrup (nancite), or fermented into chicha. This is as safe as fruit trees get."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "slow"
growthRateDetails: "Slow to moderate growth; 0.3-0.5 m/year; begins fruiting at 4-6 years; reaches mature size (8-12m) in 12-15 years; long-lived tree (50+ years productive)"
matureSize: "5-15 m tall (commonly 8-12m), crown spread 4-8 m; small to medium tree, sometimes shrubby growth habit"
hardiness: "Tropical dry to moist lowlands 0-800m; thrives in Guanacaste dry season; heat and drought tolerant; best in Pacific dry forests but grows elsewhere"
soilRequirements: "Extremely adaptable; grows in poor, sandy, rocky, clay soils; pH 5.0-7.5; tolerates infertile soils and compaction; one of least demanding fruit trees for soil"
waterNeeds: "low"
waterDetails: "Low water needs once established (2-3 years). Young trees need weekly watering first dry season. Mature trees are highly drought-tolerant and survive entirely on seasonal rainfall including 5-6 month dry periods. Actually produces best fruit during dry season stress. Overwatering not beneficial."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plant 5-8 m apart for fruit production; 6-10 m from buildings; suitable for small gardens and urban lots"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
  - "cuttings"
  - "grafting"
propagationDifficulty: "easy"
plantingSeason: "Plant in rainy season (May-June) ideal; seeds germinate easily in 2-3 weeks; can plant year-round with care; very successful establishment"
maintenanceNeeds: "EXTREMELY LOW maintenance fruit tree - one of the easiest. Years 1-3: water weekly during dry season, weed control, no fertilization needed. Years 4+: essentially maintenance-free, harvest fruit in July-September, prune only to remove dead wood or shape if desired. No pest or disease problems of significance. No fertilization required - tolerates poor soils naturally. Fruit production is heavy in years following stress (drought). PERFECT low-input fruit tree for homesteads, dry areas, neglected corners of property. Plant it and forget it."
commonProblems:
  - "Slow growth and late fruiting (4-6 years) discourages impatient planters - but worth the wait"
  - "Fruit flavor is polarizing - not universally loved, but cherished by those who grew up with it"
  - "Fruit falls when ripe and must be collected quickly before fermenting - daily harvest during season"
  - "Birds and wildlife love the fruit - expect to share the crop"
  - "Inconsistent fruiting year-to-year - heavy crops alternate with light years (normal)"
  - "Virtually pest and disease-free - one of the most trouble-free tropical fruit trees"

# Nance (Golden Spoon)

<Callout type="success" title="The Taste of Guanacaste">
  The **Nance** (_Byrsonima crassifolia_) produces one of the most distinctive
  and divisive fruits in tropical America. Its small, yellow fruits have an
  aroma and flavor that people either love or struggle with—a unique combination
  of earthy, cheesy, and sweet that has been compared to everything from strong
  cheese to soap. But for those who grew up with it, Nance is pure nostalgia:
  memories of Guanacaste summers, roadside vendors, homemade "refresco de
  nance," and the beloved "nance curtido" (nances preserved in sugar syrup).
  This humble tree, thriving in the harsh dry forests of the Pacific slope, has
  become an essential part of Costa Rican food culture— proof that the most
  meaningful flavors are often the most acquired.

## Ecological Role

### Dry Forest Resilience

<FeatureBox title="Survivor of Harsh Conditions" icon="🔥">
  Nance is superbly adapted to challenging dry forest environments: **Fire
  Resistance**: - Thick, corky bark - Resprouts vigorously after fire - Benefits
  from reduced competition - Part of fire-adapted ecosystem **Drought
  Tolerance**: - Deep root system - Thick, waxy leaves reduce water loss -
  Deciduous during severe drought - Survives extended dry seasons **Poor Soil
  Tolerance**: - Thrives on sandy, acidic soils - Common on savannas - Grows
  where many trees can't This toughness makes Nance an important species for
  degraded lands.
</FeatureBox>

### Wildlife Value

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Fruit Consumers

- **Many bird species**: Important food
- **Monkeys**: Spider, howler, white-faced
- **Bats**: Fruit bats disperse seeds
- **Coatis and raccoons**: Ground feeders
- **Wild pigs**: Fallen fruit
- **Agoutis**: Seed predators/dispersers

</Column>
<Column>

#### Pollination

- **Oil-collecting bees**: Specialized pollinators
- **Centris bees**: Primary pollinators
- **Other native bees**: Various species
- **Unique relationship**: Flowers offer oil, not nectar

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

<Callout type="info" title="Special Pollination">
  Nance flowers produce **oil instead of nectar**—a rare trait: - Specialized
  oil glands on flowers - Centris and other oil bees collect it - Bees use oil
  to provision larvae - Very specific plant-pollinator relationship This makes
  Nance important for supporting specialized bee populations.

<Callout type="success" title="An Acquired Taste, A Beloved Tradition">
  There's something profoundly human about foods that divide opinion— flavors so
  distinctive that they become cultural markers, signifying belonging to those
  who love them and adventure to those who dare to try. The Nance is such a
  fruit. Its cheese-like, earthy-sweet flavor is not for everyone, and that's
  precisely what makes it special. For the people of Guanacaste and across
  Central America, that unique taste evokes childhood summers, grandmother's
  kitchen, fiestas patronales, and the warm hospitality of offering guests a jar
  of homemade nance curtido. This tough little tree, surviving fire and drought
  in the harsh dry forests, produces a fruit that has sustained and delighted
  generations. Whether you end up loving it or politely passing, experiencing
  Nance is experiencing the real, unfiltered flavor of tropical tradition.
