# Nance (Golden Spoon)

<Callout type="success" title="The Taste of Guanacaste">
  The **Nance** (_Byrsonima crassifolia_) produces one of the most distinctive
  and divisive fruits in tropical America. Its small, yellow fruits have an
  aroma and flavor that people either love or struggle with—a unique combination
  of earthy, cheesy, and sweet that has been compared to everything from strong
  cheese to soap. But for those who grew up with it, Nance is pure nostalgia:
  memories of Guanacaste summers, roadside vendors, homemade "refresco de
  nance," and the beloved "nance curtido" (nances preserved in sugar syrup).
  This humble tree, thriving in the harsh dry forests of the Pacific slope, has
  become an essential part of Costa Rican food culture— proof that the most
  meaningful flavors are often the most acquired.

## Ecological Role

### Dry Forest Resilience

<FeatureBox title="Survivor of Harsh Conditions" icon="🔥">
  Nance is superbly adapted to challenging dry forest environments: **Fire
  Resistance**: - Thick, corky bark - Resprouts vigorously after fire - Benefits
  from reduced competition - Part of fire-adapted ecosystem **Drought
  Tolerance**: - Deep root system - Thick, waxy leaves reduce water loss -
  Deciduous during severe drought - Survives extended dry seasons **Poor Soil
  Tolerance**: - Thrives on sandy, acidic soils - Common on savannas - Grows
  where many trees can't This toughness makes Nance an important species for
  degraded lands.
</FeatureBox>

### Wildlife Value

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Fruit Consumers

- **Many bird species**: Important food
- **Monkeys**: Spider, howler, white-faced
- **Bats**: Fruit bats disperse seeds
- **Coatis and raccoons**: Ground feeders
- **Wild pigs**: Fallen fruit
- **Agoutis**: Seed predators/dispersers

</Column>
<Column>

#### Pollination

- **Oil-collecting bees**: Specialized pollinators
- **Centris bees**: Primary pollinators
- **Other native bees**: Various species
- **Unique relationship**: Flowers offer oil, not nectar

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

<Callout type="info" title="Special Pollination">
  Nance flowers produce **oil instead of nectar**—a rare trait: - Specialized
  oil glands on flowers - Centris and other oil bees collect it - Bees use oil
  to provision larvae - Very specific plant-pollinator relationship This makes
  Nance important for supporting specialized bee populations.

<Callout type="success" title="An Acquired Taste, A Beloved Tradition">
  There's something profoundly human about foods that divide opinion— flavors so
  distinctive that they become cultural markers, signifying belonging to those
  who love them and adventure to those who dare to try. The Nance is such a
  fruit. Its cheese-like, earthy-sweet flavor is not for everyone, and that's
  precisely what makes it special. For the people of Guanacaste and across
  Central America, that unique taste evokes childhood summers, grandmother's
  kitchen, fiestas patronales, and the warm hospitality of offering guests a jar
  of homemade nance curtido. This tough little tree, surviving fire and drought
  in the harsh dry forests, produces a fruit that has sustained and delighted
  generations. Whether you end up loving it or politely passing, experiencing
  Nance is experiencing the real, unfiltered flavor of tropical tradition.
