toxicityLevel: "low"
toxicParts: ["fruit-capsule-hairs"]
skinContactRisk: "moderate"
allergenRisk: "low"
structuralRisks: []
childSafe: true
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "The tree itself is non-toxic. The seeds are edible (raw or cooked) and traded locally as food, similar to other Sterculia species. The main hazard is mechanical irritation from fruit capsule hairs, not chemical toxicity. No systemic poisoning from any part of the tree."
skinContactDetails: "MODERATE risk from fruit handling. The inside of fruit capsules contains stiff, orange, needle-like bristles (urticating hairs) that penetrate skin and cause local irritation and pain. ALWAYS wear gloves when harvesting seeds or handling fruit capsules. The tree bark, leaves, and flowers are safe to touch."
allergenDetails: "LOW allergen risk. Possible minor allergic reactions or localized irritation from fruit contact, but no major toxic effects. Standard wood dust precautions apply."
safetyNotes: "SAFE TREE with fruit handling caution. The Panamá tree is safe for landscaping with no toxicity to children or pets from touching the tree. The seeds are actually edible and nutritious. CAUTION: Wear gloves when harvesting fruits to avoid painful skin irritation from the bristly hairs inside the seed capsules. The tree is valued for shade, durable wood, and as a honey plant. Excellent ornamental for dry forest landscapes."

# Panamá

<Callout type="success" title="Giant of the Dry Forest">
  The **Panamá tree** (_Sterculia apetala_) is one of the most impressive giants
  of Central American tropical dry forests. With massive buttressed trunks and
  spreading crowns reaching 45 meters, these magnificent trees are landmarks in
  Guanacaste's landscape and critical habitat for scarlet macaws.

<AccordionItem title="🔬 Taxonomic Notes">

The genus _Sterculia_ was formerly placed in its own family (Sterculiaceae), now merged into Malvaceae. The name derives from Sterculius, Roman god of manure, referring to the unpleasant smell of some species' flowers.

**Historical Significance**: Legend has it that the Republic of Panama was named after this tree, which was abundant in the area where Panama City was founded.

**Former Classification**: _Sterculia apetala_ (Aubl.) H.Karst. — The species name "apetala" means "without petals," referring to the apetalous flowers.
