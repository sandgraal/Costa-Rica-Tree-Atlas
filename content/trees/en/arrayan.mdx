# Arrayán

<Callout type="info" title="Cloud Forest Keystone">
  **Arrayán** (_Weinmannia pinnata_) is one of the most characteristic and
  ecologically important trees of Costa Rica's cloud forests. Often dominating
  the canopy between 1500-3000 meters elevation, this evergreen tree's twisted
  branches draped with mosses, lichens, and epiphytes define the misty montane
  landscapes of the Central and Talamanca mountain ranges.

### Etymology

The genus name _Weinmannia_ honors Johann Wilhelm Weinmann (1683-1741), a German botanist and pharmacist. The species epithet _pinnata_ refers to the pinnately compound leaves (feather-like arrangement of leaflets along a central stem).

---

## Physical Description

### Tree Form

**Arrayán** is a medium to large evergreen tree typically reaching 20-30 meters in height with a trunk diameter of 50-80 cm. The tree has a characteristic form adapted to cloud forest conditions:

- **Trunk**: Often twisted and gnarled, especially in exposed sites; bark is dark brown to gray, rough and deeply fissured on mature trees
- **Crown**: Irregular and spreading, often broader than tall; branches contorted and heavily laden with epiphytes
- **Growth Pattern**: Evergreen; maintains foliage year-round

### Bark Characteristics

The bark is one of the tree's distinctive features:

- Dark brown to grayish-brown color
- Deeply fissured and rough texture on mature trees
- Young bark smoother, becoming increasingly rugose with age
- Rich in tannins, historically used for leather tanning
- Often covered with mosses and lichens in humid conditions

### Leaves

</PropertiesGrid>

### Ecological Role

Arrayán plays a **keystone role** in cloud forest ecosystems:

1. **Canopy Dominant**: Often the most abundant tree species in upper montane forests
2. **Epiphyte Host**: Supports exceptional diversity of epiphytic plants (orchids, bromeliads, ferns, mosses, lichens)
3. **Wildlife Habitat**: Provides nesting sites and food for numerous highland bird species
4. **Watershed Protection**: Dense root systems stabilize steep slopes and regulate water flow
5. **Nutrient Cycling**: Leaf litter contributes to soil formation in harsh montane conditions

### Wildlife Associations

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="Birds">

Cloud forest birds extensively use Arrayán:

- **Resplendent Quetzal** (_Pharomachrus mocinno_): Uses branches for perching and nesting
- **Black-faced Solitaire** (_Myadestes melanops_): Nests in moss-covered branches

---

## Cultural & Historical Significance

### Indigenous Knowledge

Indigenous peoples throughout the tree's range have known and utilized Arrayán for generations:

- Source of materials in high-elevation settlements
- Marker of good quality land with reliable water sources
- Associated with cloud forest spirits in some highland cultures

### Place in Costa Rican Heritage

While not as culturally prominent as lowland species, Arrayán is:

- Symbolic of Costa Rica's **cloud forest ecosystems**
- Associated with the country's most pristine high-elevation protected areas

---

## Conservation Status

<ConservationStatusBox status="LC" statusText="Least Concern" trend="stable" />

### IUCN Assessment

_Weinmannia pinnata_ is assessed as **Least Concern (LC)** by the IUCN due to:

- Wide geographic distribution (Mexico to Peru)
- Occurrence in numerous protected areas
- Adaptability across a range of montane conditions
- Large total population size

### Threats & Challenges

Despite its Least Concern status, the species faces local threats:

1. **Deforestation**: Conversion of cloud forests to agriculture (especially coffee and dairy farming)
2. **Fire**: Increasingly frequent fires in degraded highland areas harm this fire-sensitive species
3. **Climate Change**:
   - Rising temperatures may shift suitable habitat upward
   - Changes in cloud patterns threaten moisture availability
   - "Lifting cloud base" phenomenon reduces habitat
4. **Fragmentation**: Isolation of cloud forest patches affects gene flow and epiphyte dispersal

### Protection Status

The species is protected through conservation of its habitat:

- **Costa Rica**: Found in numerous national parks and reserves (La Amistad, Chirripó, Poás, Barva, many others)
- **Protected Areas**: Much of its range in Costa Rica is within protected status
- **International**: Occurs in multiple UNESCO World Heritage Sites (e.g., Talamanca Range)

## Growing Arrayán

### Propagation

<PropertiesGrid>
  <PropertyCard icon="🌱" label="Seeds" value="Primary method" />
  <PropertyCard icon="✂️" label="Cuttings" value="Possible but challenging" />
  <PropertyCard icon="📅" label="Season" value="Rainy season (May-November)" />
  <PropertyCard icon="⏱️" label="Germination" value="2-4 weeks" />
</PropertiesGrid>

**From Seed**:

1. Collect capsules when they turn brown (June-September)
2. Dry capsules split open to release tiny seeds
3. Seeds are very small and require careful handling
4. Surface sow on moist, sterile medium
5. Keep consistently moist with high humidity
6. Germination occurs in 2-4 weeks
7. Seedlings grow slowly initially

**From Cuttings**:

- Semi-hardwood cuttings can root but success rate is low
- Requires mist propagation system
- Hormone treatment improves success
- Generally not recommended for large-scale propagation

### Site Requirements

**Critical**: Arrayán is **strictly a highland species** and will not survive in lowland conditions.

<PropertiesGrid>
  <PropertyCard icon="⛰️" label="Elevation" value="Above 1500 m minimum" />
  <PropertyCard icon="🌡️" label="Temperature" value="Cool (8-20°C mean)" />

5. **Initial Care**: Keep moist but not waterlogged; mulch to retain moisture

### Growth & Maintenance

- **Growth Rate**: Moderate; 1-2 feet per year in suitable conditions
- **Young Trees**: Protect from livestock if present; may need windbreak in very exposed sites
- **Pruning**: Generally unnecessary; let develop natural form
- **Fertilization**: Not needed; adapted to low-nutrient montane soils
- **Pests/Diseases**: Few significant problems; quite resistant

### Time to Maturity

- Begins flowering at **10-15 years**
- Reaches significant size at **30-50 years**
- Maximum size attained at **100+ years**

_The Arrayán (Weinmannia pinnata) is more than just a tree—it is the living architecture of Costa Rica's cloud forests. Its twisted branches, draped in gardens of epiphytes, create the misty, moss-hung landscapes that define the country's highlands. As climate change threatens these fragile ecosystems, protecting Arrayán and its cloud forest habitat becomes increasingly critical for maintaining the biodiversity and watershed functions that benefit all of Costa Rica._
