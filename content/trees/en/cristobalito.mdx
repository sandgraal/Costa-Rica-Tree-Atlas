toxicityDetails: "The living tree, leaves, flowers, and seeds are non-toxic to people and animals. No ingestion hazards are reported for fresh plant parts."
skinContactDetails: "Direct contact with leaves or bark is low risk. As with many Fabaceae hardwoods, freshly cut wood and sawdust can irritate skin; washing after handling lumber is recommended."
allergenDetails: "Wood dust from Platymiscium species is a strong respiratory and skin sensitizer. Prolonged exposure can trigger allergic rhinitis, dermatitis, or asthma-like symptoms. Always sand and mill with P100/P3 respirators, eye protection, and dust extraction."
safetyNotes: "The tree is landscape-safe for parks, schools, and households. Woodworkers should treat the lumber with the same precautions used for rosewoods: control dust, ventilate workshops, and monitor for sensitization."

## Physical & Botanical Description

- **Form:** Medium-sized deciduous hardwood with a straight, cylindrical trunk
  and a rounded to spreading crown; typically 20-30 m tall.
- **Bark:** Gray to reddish-brown, smooth to lightly fissured on young trees,
  becoming thinly plated with age; inner bark pale yellow-brown with mild
  aromatic notes.
- **Leaves:** Alternate, pinnate with 3-5 pairs of glossy, elliptic to oblong
  leaflets (5-12 cm long). Leaflets have smooth margins and a lighter underside.
- **Flowers:** Small, pale yellow to creamy-white papilionaceous flowers borne
  in panicles at branch tips; bloom near the end of the dry season (Feb-Mar)
  just before or during leaf flush. Nectar attracts bees.
- **Fruit/Seeds:** Flat, thin samaroid pods (7-12 cm) with papery wings; mature
  in April-May and disperse by wind; seeds have a hard coat that benefits from
  scarification.
- **Wood:** Heartwood ranges from orange-brown to reddish-brown with darker
  streaking; fine, even texture; interlocked grain that planes to a lustrous
  finish; density ~0.75 g/cm³; excellent dimensional stability.

---

## Geographic Distribution

- Native to lowland and premontane forests of Pacific and Atlantic slopes in
  **Costa Rica**, extending into **Nicaragua** and western **Panama**.
- In Costa Rica, most frequent in **Guanacaste**, **Puntarenas**, **Alajuela**,
  and **northern San José**; scattered records in **Limón** for Caribbean slope
  foothills.
- Elevation range: **0-900 m**, favoring foothills and valley bottoms with deep
  soils.

<DistributionMap locale="en" slug="cristobalito" />

---

## Habitat & Ecology

- Occurs in **tropical dry forest** to **moist forest** mosaics with distinct
  dry seasons; thrives in secondary forests and forest edges.
- **Nitrogen-fixing legume** that enriches soils and supports successional
  recovery in degraded pastures.
- Associates with pollinators (bees) during late dry-season bloom and provides
  nectar when few other canopy trees are flowering.
- Wind-dispersed samaras aid colonization of adjacent clearings after logging
  or fire.
- Wildlife interactions: seeds occasionally predated by rodents; canopy provides
  shade and structure for epiphytes in mature stands.

</PropertiesGrid>

- **Timber:** Premium small-diameter hardwood with outstanding finishing
  qualities; used for fine furniture, cabinetry, high-end flooring, turned
  objects, and decorative veneers.
- **Musical instruments:** Valued for guitars (backs/sides), marimba keys, and
  other acoustic instruments due to its density and tonal clarity.
- **Restoration:** Nitrogen-fixing capacity makes it useful in mixed-species
  reforestation, especially on degraded cattle pastures where soil improvement
  is needed.
- **Shade:** Suitable as a shade and ornamental tree where space allows; lighter
  crown than larger Platymiscium species.

---

## Cultural Significance

- Known as **Cristobalito** ("little Cristóbal") because it resembles the
  larger Cristóbal but remains smaller and rarer; historically favored by
  artisans for small, high-value objects.
- In woodworking communities, grouped with "macacauba" woods prized for their
  vivid colors and workability.
- Local communities in Costa Rica recognize it as a quality timber for durable
  furniture and heirloom pieces, though scarcity has limited modern use.

---

## Conservation Status & Threats

<ConservationStatus
  code="EN"
  rationale="Endangered due to selective logging, habitat loss, and limited population size"
/>

- Listed as **Endangered** in regional assessments; populations fragmented by
  agricultural expansion and historical overharvest for high-value timber.
- Regeneration is moderate; seeds require disturbance gaps and good soils.
- Conservation priorities:
  - Protect remnant stands in dry and moist forests, especially on Pacific
    slopes.
  - Promote **seed collection and nursery propagation** to diversify restoration
    plantings.
  - Encourage **legal, certified timber production** from managed plantations to
    reduce pressure on wild trees.
  - Maintain genetic diversity by sourcing seed from multiple provenances.

---

## Growing Cristobalito (Cultivation)

- **Site selection:** Full sun, deep well-drained soils; avoid sites with
  prolonged flooding.
- **Planting:** Sow scarified seeds in polybags 6-8 weeks before rains; plant
  hardened seedlings at the start of the rainy season (May-June).
- **Spacing:** 8-10 m in mixed timber blocks; wider spacing (12 m) for shade or
  ornamental use.
- **Pruning:** Years 2-4 formative pruning to maintain a single straight stem;
  remove lower branches gradually for clear boles (timber objective).
- **Watering:** Keep young trees watered during first 2-3 dry seasons; mulch to
  conserve soil moisture.
- **Fertilization:** Generally unnecessary thanks to nitrogen fixation; a light
  phosphorus application at planting can improve early growth on depleted soils.
- **Pest/Disease:** Generally resilient; monitor for caterpillars and seed
  beetles. No major pathogens reported.

## Advanced Care Guidance

### Site Design and Planting

- Establish in full sun to light shade with 8-10 m spacing for timber form and canopy health.
- Prefer well-drained, moderately fertile soils; avoid prolonged waterlogging in young stages.
- Plant at rainy-season onset and protect stems from cattle, fire, and mechanical damage.

### Watering Program

- **Establishment (0-8 months):** Deep watering weekly during dry breaks.
- **Juvenile phase (8-30 months):** Water every 10-14 days through severe dry-season intervals.
- **Established trees:** Generally low irrigation demand once roots are fully anchored.

### Fertilization Schedule

- Use compost and a phosphorus-support starter amendment at planting.
- Apply balanced fertilizer once at early rains for first 2-3 years on poor soils.
- Maintain organic mulch cover to sustain microbial activity and moisture retention.

### Pruning and Structure

- Continue formative pruning to maintain a straight trunk and evenly spaced scaffold branches.
- Remove codominant leaders early to reduce future stem defects.
- Prune lightly after wet-season growth flushes to avoid excessive stress.

### Pest and Disease Management

- Monitor for caterpillars, seed beetles, and branch dieback during humidity transitions.
- Remove infested material promptly and keep nursery/field sanitation high.
- Encourage mixed-species planting to reduce single-pest pressure.

### Companion Planting

- **Recommended companions:** Chirraca, guachipelin, guaba species, and native flowering shrubs for pollinators.
- **Agroforestry role:** Nitrogen-supporting timber tree in diversified dry-forest restoration blocks.
- **Avoid nearby:** Dense aggressive grasses that outcompete juvenile root systems.

### Seasonal Care Calendar (Costa Rican Conditions)

- **Dry season (Dec-Apr):** Juvenile irrigation support, firebreak maintenance, and structural checks.
- **Early rains (May-Jul):** Main planting window, fertility support, and weed suppression.
- **Peak rains (Aug-Oct):** Growth monitoring, sanitation pruning, and pest scouting.
- **Transition (Nov):** Mulch renewal and planning for next establishment cycle.

### Growth Timeline and Management Notes

- Moderate growth with strong wood-quality potential under low-input management.
- Stem quality decisions in years 2-6 strongly influence long-term timber value.
- Integrate as a long-horizon restoration and specialty timber component rather than short-rotation crop.
