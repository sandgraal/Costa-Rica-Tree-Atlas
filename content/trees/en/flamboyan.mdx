# Flamboyán

<Callout type="info" title="The Flame Tree">
  The **Flamboyán** (_Delonix regia_), also known as Royal Poinciana or Flame
  Tree, is arguably one of the most spectacular flowering trees on Earth. When
  in full bloom, the entire crown transforms into a blazing canopy of
  scarlet-orange flowers, creating a sight so dramatic that it has inspired
  artists, poets, and gardeners across the tropics for centuries. Though native
  to Madagascar where it is now endangered in the wild, the Flamboyán has become
  one of the most widely cultivated ornamental trees in the world, gracing
  parks, streets, and gardens throughout Costa Rica and beyond.

## Distribution and Habitat

### Native Range

<DistributionMap countries={["Madagascar"]} />

The Flamboyán is endemic to Madagascar's dry deciduous forests on the western coast. In its native range, it is now classified as **Vulnerable** due to habitat loss from charcoal production. Ironically, while endangered in Madagascar, it is one of the most widely cultivated ornamental trees in the tropical world.

### Distribution in Costa Rica

As an introduced ornamental, the Flamboyán is cultivated throughout Costa Rica's lowland and mid-elevation areas. It thrives particularly well in the drier Pacific slope regions where the distinct dry season promotes prolific flowering.

## Conservation Status

### Current Assessment

<QuickRef
  title="Conservation Status"
  items={[
    { label: "IUCN Red List", value: "Vulnerable (VU) in wild" },
    { label: "Population Trend", value: "Declining in Madagascar" },

    { label: "Cultivation Status", value: "Extremely common worldwide" },
  ]}
/>

### Conservation Paradox

<Callout type="info" title="Rare in the Wild, Common in Cultivation">
  The Flamboyán presents a fascinating conservation paradox. In its native
  Madagascar, it is classified as **Vulnerable** and becoming increasingly rare
  due to deforestation for charcoal production. The species was so rare in the
  wild that its natural origin remained unknown until 1932, when a natural
  colony was finally discovered on Madagascar's west coast.

Yet worldwide, the Flamboyán is one of the most commonly planted ornamental
trees in tropical and subtropical regions. This cultivation success means the
species is in no danger of extinction, even as wild populations decline.
Conservation efforts focus on protecting remaining native populations in
Madagascar's dry deciduous forests.

8. First flowers in 4-5 years

**From Cuttings**

- Semi-hardwood cuttings possible
- Slower than seeds (months to root)
- Used for yellow variety to ensure true form

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

### Maintenance Requirements

<SimpleList
  items={[
    "Years 1-3: Regular watering during establishment, weed control",
    "Years 4-5: Begin to expect first flowering",
    "Young trees: Prune carefully to develop good crown form",
    "Mature trees: Minimal care needed; very drought tolerant",
    "Pruning: Responds well to pollarding if needed",
    "Root management: Keep away from sidewalks and foundations",
    "Wind protection: Plant in sheltered locations (brittle wood)",
  ]}
/>

### Common Issues

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Shallow Root System" defaultOpen={true}>
    The Flamboyán has a notorious shallow, spreading root system that:
    - Can lift and crack sidewalks and driveways
    - May damage foundations if planted too close to buildings
    - Creates bare ground under the canopy (outcompetes grass)
    - Makes the tree prone to toppling in strong winds

    **Solution**: Plant at least 10-15 meters from any paved surfaces or structures.

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Wind Damage">
    The wood is soft and brittle, making branches prone to breaking in storms. Combined with the shallow roots, strong winds can uproot entire trees.

    **Solution**: Plant in sheltered locations protected from strong winds. Prune to reduce wind resistance if needed.

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Poor Flowering">
    In consistently wet climates or shaded conditions, the tree may produce few flowers or none at all.

    **Causes**:
    - Too much rainfall / no dry season
    - Insufficient sunlight
    - Too young (under 4-5 years)
    - Excessive nitrogen fertilization

    **Solution**: Plant only in full sun locations in areas with a distinct dry season. Avoid fertilizing mature trees.

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Messy Seed Pods">
    The large seed pods (up to 60 cm) can be messy when they fall, littering the ground for months.

    **Solution**: Accept as part of the tree's character, or plant where falling pods won't be problematic. Pods can be collected for crafts.

  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

<Callout type="tip" title="A Living Flame">
  Few trees can match the Flamboyán's ability to transform a landscape into a
  spectacle of color. When these trees burst into bloom at the end of the dry
  season, they create what can only be described as a fire in the sky—a living
  flame that marks the transition from dry to wet season across Costa Rica's
  lowlands. Whether planted as a single specimen in a garden or lining an avenue
  in a small town, the Flamboyán never fails to stop passersby in their tracks.
  It reminds us that trees can be more than just plants—they can be living art,
  marking the seasons and generations with their unforgettable displays.
