# Mamón (Spanish Lime)

<Callout type="success" title="Summer's Favorite Street Fruit">
  The **Mamón** (_Melicoccus bijugatus_), known in English as Spanish Lime or
  Genip, is one of the most eagerly anticipated seasonal fruits in Costa Rica.
  When June arrives and the mamón season begins, streets come alive with vendors
  selling bunches of these small, round green fruits. Cracking open the brittle
  shell reveals translucent, salmon-pink flesh that clings tightly to a large
  seed—you don't bite it, you suck the sweet-tart pulp, working the seed in your
  mouth to extract every bit of flavor. It's messy, addictive, and thoroughly
  tropical. Native to the Caribbean, the mamón has become a cherished part of
  Costa Rican street food culture.

## Physical Description

### General Form

The Mamón is a handsome, medium to large tree with a dense, rounded crown that provides excellent shade. It's slow-growing but long-lived, eventually becoming a substantial presence in the landscape. The tree is semi-deciduous, losing leaves briefly during the dry season.

  2. Pop the fruit in your mouth
  3. SUCK the gelatinous flesh off the large seed
  4. Work the seed with your tongue to get all the pulp

## Cultivation

### Growing Mamón

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Site Selection">
    **Ideal Conditions**:
    - Full sun
    - Deep, well-drained soil
    - Space for large tree (15+ m spread)
    - Protection from strong winds when young
    - Lowland to mid-elevation

    **Considerations**:
    - Slow growth—patience required
    - Both male and female trees needed for fruit
    - Fruit drop can be messy
    - Long-lived investment (50+ years)

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Propagation">
    **From Seed** (most common):
    - Use fresh seeds immediately
    - Plant 2-3 cm deep
    - Germination in 1-3 weeks
    - Slow early growth
    - Fruit in 8-10 years
    - Sex unknown until flowering

    **Air Layering** (for known sex):
    - Allows selecting female trees
    - Faster fruiting (4-5 years)
    - Maintains parent characteristics

    **Grafting**:
    - For superior varieties
    - Ensures female trees
    - Difficult but possible

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Care">
    **Watering**: Regular when young, drought-tolerant when mature

    **Fertilization**: Light fertilization in growing season

    **Pruning**: Minimal needed; shape when young

    **Pest/Disease**: Generally problem-free

    **Harvest**: When fruit easily detaches from cluster

## Cultural Significance

### In Costa Rican Life

<FeatureBox title="A Seasonal Celebration" icon="🎉">
  Mamón season marks a distinct time in Costa Rican culture:

- **Anticipation**: People wait all year for mamón
- **Social eating**: Shared among friends and family
- **Childhood memories**: Associated with school and summer
- **Street culture**: Part of informal economy
- **Regional identity**: Common throughout Pacific coast

The short season (2-3 months) makes the fruit more special—when it's gone, you wait another year!
