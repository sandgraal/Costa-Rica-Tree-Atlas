toxicityDetails: "Mamón is completely safe and non-toxic. The fruit is widely consumed by people of all ages throughout the Caribbean and Latin America. The translucent salmon-pink flesh around the seed is edible - sweet-tart flavor. The seed itself is very large and hard (choking hazard for very young children) but non-toxic. Some people roast and eat the seeds. The thin green shell is not eaten but is non-toxic. Children throughout Costa Rica safely crack open and eat mamones as street snacks."
skinContactDetails: "No skin irritation. Safe to handle tree and fruits."
safetyNotes: "Exceptionally safe fruit tree excellent for home gardens and street planting. The main safety consideration is the LARGE HARD SEED which is a CHOKING HAZARD for very young children (under 3 years). Children should be supervised to suck the flesh and spit out the seed, not attempt to swallow it whole. Otherwise completely safe. The fruit grows in clusters and is harvested by pulling bunches from the tree. Popular street vendor fruit sold in bags."
wildlifeRisks: "Safe for all animals. Birds, bats, and mammals eat fallen fruit safely."

# Mamón (Spanish Lime)

<Callout type="success" title="Summer's Favorite Street Fruit">
  The **Mamón** (_Melicoccus bijugatus_), known in English as Spanish Lime or
  Genip, is one of the most eagerly anticipated seasonal fruits in Costa Rica.
  When June arrives and the mamón season begins, streets come alive with vendors
  selling bunches of these small, round green fruits. Cracking open the brittle
  shell reveals translucent, salmon-pink flesh that clings tightly to a large
  seed—you don't bite it, you suck the sweet-tart pulp, working the seed in your
  mouth to extract every bit of flavor. It's messy, addictive, and thoroughly
  tropical. Native to the Caribbean, the mamón has become a cherished part of
  Costa Rican street food culture.

## Cultivation

### Growing Mamón

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Site Selection">
    **Ideal Conditions**:
    - Full sun
    - Deep, well-drained soil
    - Space for large tree (15+ m spread)
    - Protection from strong winds when young
    - Lowland to mid-elevation

    **Considerations**:
    - Slow growth—patience required
    - Both male and female trees needed for fruit
    - Fruit drop can be messy
    - Long-lived investment (50+ years)

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Propagation">
    **From Seed** (most common):
    - Use fresh seeds immediately
    - Plant 2-3 cm deep
    - Germination in 1-3 weeks
    - Slow early growth
    - Fruit in 8-10 years
    - Sex unknown until flowering

    **Air Layering** (for known sex):
    - Allows selecting female trees
    - Faster fruiting (4-5 years)
    - Maintains parent characteristics

    **Grafting**:
    - For superior varieties
    - Ensures female trees
    - Difficult but possible

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Care">
    **Watering**: Regular when young, drought-tolerant when mature

    **Fertilization**: Light fertilization in growing season

    **Pruning**: Minimal needed; shape when young

    **Pest/Disease**: Generally problem-free

    **Harvest**: When fruit easily detaches from cluster

## Cultural & Historical Significance

### Origins and Spread

The mamón's story begins in the Caribbean basin and northern South America, where it has been cultivated for millennia. Archaeological evidence from pre-Columbian sites in Colombia and Venezuela suggests indigenous peoples valued the tree not only for its fruit but for its hard, durable wood and medicinal bark. Spanish colonizers encountered the fruit in the Caribbean and spread it throughout their colonial territories during the 16th and 17th centuries.

The name "mamón" likely derives from the Spanish verb _mamar_ (to suck), describing the eating technique. In English, "Spanish Lime" is a misnomer—the tree is not related to limes at all but belongs to the soapberry family alongside lychee and rambutan. The scientific name _Melicoccus_ (Greek for "honey berry") better captures the fruit's sweet nature.

### In Costa Rican Life

<FeatureBox title="A Seasonal Celebration" icon="🎉">
  Mamón season marks a distinct time in Costa Rican culture:

- **Anticipation**: People wait all year for mamón
- **Social eating**: Shared among friends and family
- **Childhood memories**: Associated with school and summer
- **Street culture**: Part of informal economy
- **Regional identity**: Common throughout Pacific coast

The short season (2-3 months) makes the fruit more special—when it's gone, you wait another year!

</FeatureBox>

### Economic Role

<DataTable

    ["Street vendors", "Significant", "Seasonal income source"],

    ["Processing", "Minimal", "Mostly fresh consumption"],
    ["Export", "Negligible", "Consumed domestically"],
    ["Honey production", "Emerging", "Excellent nectar source for bees"],
  ]}
/>

### Caribbean Heritage

<Callout type="info" title="A Fruit of Many Names">
  The mamón's cultural reach is reflected in its many names across the Caribbean:

- **Jamaica**: Guinep—children climb trees to harvest clusters, a rite of passage
- **Puerto Rico**: Quenepa—celebrated in the annual _Festival de la Quenepa_ in Ponce
- **Trinidad**: Chenette—street vendors sell bags tied with colorful ribbons
- **Barbados**: Ackee (not related to Jamaican ackee)—market tradition
- **Mexico**: Guaya—popular in Yucatán and Veracruz coastal communities

In each culture, the mamón embodies childhood, summer, and the communal joy of seasonal abundance. The fruit is so culturally important that it appears in Caribbean folk songs, literature, and regional festivals.

## Conservation Status

<Callout type="info" title="Conservation Assessment">
  **IUCN Status**: Least Concern (LC)

The mamón (_Melicoccus bijugatus_) is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. The species is widely distributed and extensively cultivated throughout the Neotropics. While not native to Costa Rica, it has naturalized successfully and is not considered invasive—it does not aggressively displace native vegetation.

</Callout>

### Threats and Challenges

<PropertiesGrid>
  <PropertyCard
    title="Genetic Erosion"
    value="Most mamón trees are seedlings, resulting in high variability. Superior cultivars with larger fruit or higher pulp-to-seed ratios are being lost as old trees are removed during urbanization."
  />
  <PropertyCard
    title="Climate Sensitivity"
    value="Flowering and fruiting depend on seasonal cues. Irregular rainfall patterns from climate change can reduce fruit set or shift fruiting seasons, disrupting the cultural traditions associated with the fruit."
  />
  <PropertyCard
    title="Urban Development"
    value="Large mamón trees in urban areas are sometimes removed for construction. These long-lived specimens (50-100 years) cannot be quickly replaced due to the tree's slow growth."
  />
  <PropertyCard
    title="Dioecious Challenge"
    value="Mamón requires both male and female trees for fruit production. Random seedling planting means some areas lack adequate pollination, reducing fruit yields."
  />
