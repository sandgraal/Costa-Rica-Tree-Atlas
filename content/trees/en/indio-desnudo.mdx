# Indio Desnudo (Gumbo-Limbo)

<Callout type="info" title="The Tourist Tree">
  The **Indio Desnudo** (_Bursera simaruba_), also known as the **Gumbo-Limbo**
  or **Tourist Tree** (because its bark peels and turns red "like sunburned
  tourists"), is one of the most distinctive trees in the Neotropics. Its
  **peeling reddish-bronze bark** revealing smooth green layers beneath is
  unmistakable. This drought-tolerant, salt-tolerant pioneer thrives from
  Florida beaches to Costa Rican dry forests, propagates easily from large
  cuttings, and has been used for living fences and traditional medicine for
  millennia.

## Physical Description

### General Form

Indio Desnudo is a medium-sized deciduous tree with a distinctive short trunk that often branches low, creating a spreading, irregular crown. The entire tree appears to glow reddish-bronze when the bark is actively peeling, which is most of the year. The aromatic resin, thick fleshy leaves, and ability to root from cuttings make it unmistakable.

### Distinctive Features

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### The Famous Bark

- **Color**: Reddish-bronze, copper, cinnamon
- **Texture**: Paper-thin outer layers peel continuously
- **Under-Bark**: Smooth, bright green (photosynthetic!)
- **Function**: Water retention, photosynthesis when leafless
- **Feel**: Cool and smooth to touch
- **Resin**: Aromatic, sticky when cut

#### Trunk & Branches

- **Form**: Often short, branching low
- **Branches**: Thick, spreading, sometimes contorted
- **Bark Peeling**: Most prominent on younger portions

</Column>
<Column>

#### Leaves

- **Type**: Pinnately compound
- **Leaflets**: 5-9, alternate
- **Size**: Leaflets 4-8 cm long
- **Texture**: Thick, somewhat succulent
- **Deciduous**: Drops leaves in dry season
- **Odor**: Aromatic when crushed

#### Flowers & Fruits

- **Flowers**: Small, yellowish-green, inconspicuous
- **Arrangement**: Panicles
- **Timing**: Early dry season before leaves
- **Fruits**: Small drupes, red when ripe
- **Seeds**: Bird-dispersed
- **Attractiveness**: Birds love the fruits

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

<Callout type="tip" title="Why the Peeling Bark?">
  The peeling bark is a brilliant drought adaptation: 1. **Photosynthetic
  bark**: The green under-layer photosynthesizes even when the tree has dropped
  its leaves in dry season 2. **Water conservation**: Smooth bark reduces water
  loss compared to fissured bark 3. **Parasite prevention**: Constant peeling
  removes epiphytes, lichens, and parasitic vines before they can establish 4.
  **Heat reflection**: The coppery color reflects sunlight, keeping the tree
  cool It's evolution's elegant solution to surviving intense dry seasons!

## Ecological Importance

### Dry Forest Ecosystem Role

<Callout type="success" title="A Dry Forest Keystone">
  Indio Desnudo is critical to dry forest ecosystems: - **Early Colonizer**:
  Among first trees to establish on disturbed sites - **Dry Season Food**:
  Fruits ripen when few other foods available - **Bird Magnet**: 30+ bird
  species eat fruits - **Photosynthesis Year-Round**: Green bark when deciduous
  - **Soil Stabilization**: Deep roots prevent erosion - **Nurse Plant**:
  Provides shade for later succession species Losing Indio Desnudo would
  impoverish dry forest bird communities.

## Traditional Uses

### Medicinal Applications

<FeatureBox title="The Pharmacy Tree" icon="🌿">
  Indigenous and rural people have used Indio Desnudo medicinally for centuries:
  - **Bark Tea**: Fever reduction, flu symptoms - **Resin**: Wound healing,
  stops bleeding - **Leaf Poultice**: Skin conditions, insect bites - **Bark
  Wash**: Rashes, sunburn (hence "tourist tree"!) - **Internally**: Traditional
  digestive remedies Modern research has found anti-inflammatory and
  antimicrobial compounds supporting some traditional uses.

  ]}
/>

### Living Fences

<Callout type="tip" title="The Original Living Fence">
  Indio Desnudo is one of the easiest trees to establish as living fence posts:
  1. **Cut stakes 1.5-2.5 m long, 10-20 cm diameter** 2. **Plant directly in
  ground at start of rains** 3. **Stakes will root and leaf out within weeks**
  4. **Success rate often 90-100%** 5. **Wire can be attached directly to
  growing posts** In Guanacaste, living fences of Indio Desnudo are a defining
  feature of the rural landscape—glowing red-bronze fence lines that grow rather
  than rot.

## Cultivation and Propagation

### Growing Indio Desnudo

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Propagation Methods

**Large Cuttings (Preferred)**

1. Cut stakes during dormant season (dry season)
2. Stakes 1.5-3 m long, 10-20 cm diameter
3. Plant immediately or store briefly in shade
4. Plant 30-50 cm deep
5. Will root in weeks when rains arrive
6. Near 100% success rate

**Seeds**

1. Collect red ripe fruits
2. Clean pulp from seeds
3. Plant fresh (short viability)
4. Germination in 2-4 weeks
5. Slower than cuttings but works

</Column>
<Column>

#### Growing Conditions

<SimpleList
  items={[
    "Sun: Full sun to partial shade",
    "Soil: Extremely tolerant—rocky, sandy, clay",
    "Water: Very drought tolerant once established",
    "Salt: Highly tolerant—coastal planting OK",
    "Frost: Sensitive; tropical only",
    "Growth Rate: Fast (1-2 m/year)",
    "Spacing: 3-5 m for fences; wider for trees",
  ]}
/>

#### Notes

- Cuttings are so easy this is the primary method
- Excellent for reclaiming degraded land
- Good for slopes, erosion control
- Tolerates hurricane damage, resprouts

    peel but different color, range | | _Spondias mombin_ (Jobo) | Fissured
    bark, different fruits | | Manzanillo | Doesn't peel, toxic! | The peeling
    copper-red bark with green underneath is essentially unique.

<Callout type="success" title="Nature's Artistry">
  Few trees are as instantly recognizable as the Indio Desnudo. That glowing
  copper bark—peeling in paper-thin sheets to reveal jade-green layers
  beneath—is nature's own masterpiece. But the beauty isn't just aesthetic; it's
  functional, allowing the tree to photosynthesize even without leaves, shed
  parasites, conserve water, and thrive in the harsh dry season. Next time
  you're in Guanacaste and see those reddish fence lines glowing in the
  afternoon sun, appreciate the remarkable tree that grows its own fence posts
  while looking beautiful doing it.
