description: "The Jaboncillo (Soapberry or Western Soapberry) is nature's own soap dispenser. This elegant medium-sized tree produces round golden fruits that contain saponins—natural surfactants that foam in water just like soap. Indigenous peoples and rural communities have used these fruits to wash clothes, hair, and bodies for millennia, long before synthetic detergents existed. Native from the southern United States to Argentina, the Jaboncillo thrives in Costa Rica's dry Pacific regions. Beyond its practical cleaning uses, the tree has beautiful pinnate leaves, provides wildlife food, and offers an increasingly popular eco-friendly alternative to chemical detergents. The hard black seeds inside the fruits have been used as beads, buttons, and in traditional jewelry throughout the Americas."

toxicityDetails: "Fruits contain high concentrations of saponins (natural soap compounds) that are toxic if ingested. Saponins cause gastrointestinal irritation - symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Traditional use as fish poison demonstrates toxicity level - saponins disrupt fish gill function. Children may be attracted to the golden fruits. NOT for internal consumption. Seeds also contain toxic compounds. However, external use for washing is safe and traditional."
skinContactDetails: "Generally safe for skin contact. Saponins are used externally for washing without harm. However, avoid eye contact as saponins cause irritation. Some individuals may experience mild skin irritation with prolonged contact. Rinse thoroughly after use."
safetyNotes: "Fruits are for EXTERNAL USE ONLY - washing clothes, hair, body. Do NOT eat the fruits or seeds despite their attractive appearance. The same compounds that make excellent natural soap are toxic internally. Keep fruits away from children who might mistake them for food. Traditionally used as fish poison (now illegal in most areas) which demonstrates internal toxicity. Safe when used properly as natural soap substitute."
wildlifeRisks: "Toxic to fish (historical fishing method). May cause gastrointestinal upset in dogs and cats if consumed. However, some birds eat the fruits safely. Keep pets from eating fallen fruits."

# Jaboncillo (Soapberry Tree)

<Callout type="success" title="Nature's Soap Tree">
  The **Jaboncillo** (_Sapindus saponaria_), known as the Soapberry or Western
  Soapberry, is a living testament to nature's ingenuity. Its golden fruits
  contain saponins—natural soap compounds that foam when agitated in water. Long
  before synthetic detergents, indigenous peoples across the Americas washed
  their clothes, hair, and bodies with these remarkable fruits. The tree itself
  is graceful, with feathery pinnate leaves and spreading branches that provide
  welcome shade in dry season. In Costa Rica's Guanacaste region, the Jaboncillo
  has served rural communities for generations, and today finds new appreciation
  among those seeking natural, biodegradable alternatives to chemical soaps. The
  hard black seeds, once stripped of their soapy coating, become beads for
  jewelry—another gift from this generous tree.

## The Natural Soap

<FeatureBox title="How Soapberries Work" icon="🧼">
  The Jaboncillo's fruits are nature's soap factory: **What Makes Them Soapy**:
  - **Saponins**: Natural surfactant compounds - Surfactants = lower water
  surface tension - Creates foam when agitated - Emulsifies oils and dirt - Same
  basic action as soap! **Saponin Content**: - About 10-15% saponin in fruit -
  Concentrated in fleshy part - Not in the seed - Most effective when fresh
  **How to Use**: 1. Remove black seed from fruit 2. Place fruits in water 3.
  Agitate (rub, squeeze, shake) 4. Foam develops! 5. Use foam for washing
  **Effectiveness**: - Genuinely cleans clothes - Works for hair (shampoo) -
  General body washing - Gentler than many detergents This is NOT a folk
  myth—it's real chemistry!
</FeatureBox>

### Traditional Uses

<DataTable
  headers={["Use", "Method", "Notes"]}
  rows={[
    ["Laundry", "Crush fruits, agitate in water", "Traditional washing"],

<Callout type="warning" title="Toxicity Warning">
  Saponins that make soapberries useful also make them toxic if consumed: **Do
  NOT Eat the Fruits**: - Saponins are toxic internally - Can cause vomiting,
  diarrhea - Fish-stunning use shows toxicity - Keep away from children **Safe
  External Use**: - External washing is safe - Rinse thoroughly - Avoid eye
  contact - Normal soap precautions **Traditional Fish Stunning**: - Saponins
  stun/kill fish - Historical fishing method - Now usually illegal -
  Demonstrates toxicity level

<Callout type="success" title="The Original Eco-Detergent">
  In an age of chemical detergents and microplastic pollution, the Jaboncillo
  offers an ancient solution that requires no factory, no packaging, no
  petroleum. For thousands of years before anyone coined the term "sustainable,"
  indigenous peoples across the Americas simply picked these golden fruits and
  washed with them. The saponins that make the fruit foam are the same compounds
  that scientists now study for their pharmaceutical potential. The hard black
  seeds that once adorned pre-Columbian jewelry now find their way into
  eco-conscious craft markets. And the tree itself asks little—some dry-season
  sun, rocky soil if that's all you have, the occasional drought that would kill
  lesser plants. The Jaboncillo stands in Guanacaste's pastures, unremarkable
  until you pick a fruit and rub it between your hands. Then the foam rises,
  ancient chemistry activated by simple friction, and you understand why this
  tree has earned its name: Jaboncillo, the little soap tree, nature's gift to
  anyone who ever needed to get clean. In rural Costa Rica, grandmothers still
  remember washing clothes this way. In cities around the world, young people
  now seek out these same "soap nuts" as an alternative to chemical detergents.
  Past and future meet in a golden fruit and its perfect black seed.
