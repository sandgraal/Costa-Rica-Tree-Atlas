## Physical Description

### Overall Form

Granadillo is a medium-sized deciduous tree with a generally straight, cylindrical trunk—a valuable characteristic for timber production. Trees typically develop an open, spreading crown when growing in open conditions, but form taller, more vertical crowns in forest settings. The tree loses its leaves during the dry season, a common adaptation in its native range.

### Forest Type & Ecological Role

Granadillo is found across multiple forest types, reflecting its ecological flexibility:

1. **Tropical Dry Forests** (Pacific lowlands)
   - Deciduous forests of Guanacaste
   - Associates with other dry forest legumes
   - Loses leaves in 4-6 month dry season

2. **Moist Intermediate Forests** (500-1500m)
   - Transitional zones between dry and wet
   - Mixed forest composition
   - Partially deciduous behavior

3. **Secondary Growth** (disturbed areas)
   - Colonizes gaps and edges
   - Moderate pioneer ability
   - Benefits from canopy openings

### Wildlife Associations

As a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family, Granadillo plays important ecological roles:

- **Nitrogen Fixation**: Like many legumes, fixes atmospheric nitrogen, enriching soil
- **Bee Forage**: Flowers provide nectar and pollen for native bees
- **Seed Dispersal**: Wind-dispersed samaras colonize open areas
- **Insect Habitat**: Foliage supports various caterpillar and beetle species
- **Not Major Wildlife Food**: Unlike some legumes, seeds not heavily consumed by mammals

### Soil & Water Relations

Granadillo demonstrates good drought tolerance while preferring moderate moisture:

- **Drought Adaptation**: Deep taproot system allows dry season survival
- **Drainage Critical**: Will not tolerate waterlogged or poorly drained soils
- **Moisture Preference**: Best growth with consistent but not excessive moisture
- **Dry Season**: Fully deciduous, conserving water during driest months
- **Soil Improvement**: Nitrogen fixation benefits neighboring plants
