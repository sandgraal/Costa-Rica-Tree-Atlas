# Granadillo (Guatemalan Rosewood)

<Callout type="warning" title="Conservation Status">
  Granadillo is currently listed as **Vulnerable** on the IUCN Red List. Due to
  its valuable timber, distinct from but related to Cocobolo, it faces pressure
  from over-harvesting. It is protected under **CITES Appendix II**, regulating
  its international trade to ensure survival.

## Taxonomy

**Dalbergia tucurensis** belongs to the Fabaceae (legume) family. It is a true rosewood, closely related to the critically endangered **Cocobolo** (_Dalbergia retusa_). However, Granadillo is distinguished by its generally lighter heartwood, lack of allergenic oils, and different leaf structure.

## Physical Description

Granadillo is a medium-sized deciduous tree reaching up to **25 meters** in height with a straight, cylindrical trunk up to 60-80 cm in diameter.

- **Bark:** Smooth to slightly fissured, greyish in color, distinct from the rougher bark of some other _Dalbergia_ species.
- **Leaves:** Compound, imparipinnate, typically with 9-15 leaflets. The leaflets are lighter green and slightly thinner than those of _D. retusa_.
- **Flowers:** Small, white to cream-colored, arranged in axillary panicles. They appear during the dry season.
- **Fruit:** Flat, oblong, thin paper-like pods (samaras) containing 1-2 seeds. They mature from green to yellow-brown.
- **Wood:** The heartwood ranges from golden-orange to reddish-brown, often with darker streaks but generally lacking the intense orange/black contrast and oily feel of Cocobolo. It is dense, durable, and possesses exceptional acoustic properties.

## Distribution and Habitat

Native from Southern Mexico through Central America to Panama. In Costa Rica, it is found on both the Pacific and Atlantic slopes, adapting to a wider range of conditions than Cocobolo.

It thrives in:

- Tropical dry forests
- Moist intermediate forests
- Elevations from 100m up to 1500m

Its wider elevational range allows it to grow in areas like the Central Valley (Heredia, San José) as well as the drier Guanacaste region.

## Uses

Granadillo is a **premier tonewood**, highly sought after for:

- **Musical Instruments:** Marimbas, guitars (backs/sides), and clarinets. Its density and resonance ("the wood that sings") make it a preferred substitute for Brazilian Rosewood.
- **Fine Woodworking:** Furniture, cabinetry, and decorative boxes.
- **Turnery:** Pens, bowls, and tool handles.

Unlike Cocobolo, Granadillo is easier to glue and finish because explicitly it lacks the heavy natural oils that can interfere with finishes.

## Cultivation

- **Growth Rate:** Moderate to slow, though typically faster than Cocobolo.
- **Light:** Requires full sun for best growth.
- **Soil:** Tolerates a range of soils but prefers well-drained, fertile sites.
- **Propagation:** Primarily by seeds, which should be collected when pods are dry and brown.

## Safety & Allergies

A key advantage of Granadillo over Cocobolo is its safety profile.

- **Hypoallergenic:** It is generally considered non-allergenic and does not typically cause the severe contact dermatitis (rashes) associated with the quinones in Cocobolo (_D. retusa_).
- **Working Properties:** It produces less irritating dust, though standard respiratory protection is always recommended when sanding any tropical hardwood.
