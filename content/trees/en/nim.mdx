toxicityDetails: "Neem has useful medicinal compounds but should be treated with caution. Concentrated neem seed oil and seed extracts are not safe for children, pregnant people, or pets when ingested in significant quantities. Bitter compounds (including azadirachtin and related limonoids) can cause nausea, vomiting, and neurological symptoms in overdose situations. Raw seeds and highly concentrated homemade extracts should never be consumed."
skinContactDetails: "Most people handle leaves and bark without major irritation. Sensitive individuals may develop mild dermatitis after prolonged contact with concentrated oil or fresh sap. Use gloves when preparing extracts or handling large quantities of seeds."
allergenDetails: "Allergy risk is generally low, but pollen or strong neem odors can occasionally irritate sensitive people. Wood dust and concentrated oils may trigger mild respiratory irritation in exposed workers."
structuralRiskDetails: "Neem develops a broad crown and can drop medium branches during strong winds or after prolonged drought stress. In compact urban sites, roots may lift pavements if planted too close. Prune periodically and plant away from narrow sidewalks and buried infrastructure."
safetyNotes: "Neem is a valuable tree but not a snack tree. Keep seeds and concentrated oil products away from children and pets. Use standardized, diluted formulations for garden use and avoid improvised high-dose remedies. Planting is suitable in Costa Rica when managed responsibly and when spread is monitored in sensitive habitats."
wildlifeRisks: "Generally moderate wildlife risk. Flowers can support insects, but concentrated seed products may harm non-target organisms if applied carelessly. Avoid spraying neem extracts during peak pollinator activity and never dump concentrated residues into waterways."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "fast"
growthRateDetails: "Fast in warm lowlands; often 0.8-1.5 m per year in establishment phase under full sun"
matureSize: "12-25 m tall, crown spread 8-15 m depending on water and pruning"
hardiness: "Best in tropical/subtropical lowlands and dry zones; tolerates heat and seasonal drought"
soilRequirements: "Well-drained soils preferred; tolerates poor, sandy, and moderately alkaline soils; avoid prolonged waterlogging"
waterNeeds: "low"
waterDetails: "Low to moderate once established. Young trees need supplemental watering through first two dry seasons; mature trees tolerate extended dry periods."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plant 8-12 m from buildings and 6-10 m between trees for shade and airflow"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
  - "seedlings"
  - "grafting"
propagationDifficulty: "easy"
plantingSeason: "Early rainy season (May-July) is ideal; container seedlings can be planted year-round with irrigation"
maintenanceNeeds: "Low to moderate. Train a single central stem in first years, prune crossing limbs, and remove dead branches before storm season. Keep mulch ring weed-free during establishment. Monitor volunteer seedlings in disturbed sites and remove where spread is undesirable."
commonProblems:
  - "Root stress in heavy waterlogged soils"
  - "Crown thinning under prolonged cold or shade"
  - "Occasional branch drop in windy dry seasons"
  - "Misuse of concentrated seed oil causing safety incidents"

# Neem (Nim)

<Callout type="tip" title="A Practical Tree for Dry Tropical Landscapes">
  **Neem** (_Azadirachta indica_), known locally as **Nim**, is an introduced
  but highly practical tree in Costa Rica’s dry and urban zones. It is valued
  for shade, drought tolerance, and traditional plant-based pest management.
  Neem is not a universal solution, but when managed correctly it can support
  heat-resilient streetscapes, smallholder agroforestry, and low-input land
  rehabilitation.

### Global Context

Neem has been planted across the tropics for more than a century, especially in
regions seeking drought-tolerant shade and low-cost botanical pest management.
It is now present in parts of Africa, Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, and the
American tropics.

### Distribution in Costa Rica

In Costa Rica, neem appears mostly in:

- **Guanacaste and dry Pacific sectors** (roadsides, farms, schools, parks)
- **Urban heat islands** in lowland cities where shade demand is high
- **Agroforestry edges** and mixed farms with low irrigation availability
- **Demonstration plots** for botanical pest management

Neem is less common in waterlogged Caribbean lowlands and cool, very wet
highlands.

### Establishment and Monitoring Considerations

Neem is not currently documented as a top-tier invasive threat in Costa Rica at
a national scale, but local monitoring is still advisable where disturbed,
open habitats surround native dry-forest fragments.

### Ecological Caveats

<Callout type="warning" title="Use with ecological judgment">
  Neem can be beneficial in built or heavily altered landscapes, but planting
  should avoid sensitive restoration cores and dry-forest remnants where
  introduced species pressure is already high. Prefer native species in priority
  biodiversity corridors.

## Botanical Description

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Tree Form" defaultOpen={true}>
    Mature neem typically has a straight to slightly sinuous trunk, an open to
    rounded crown, and a robust branching system that casts broad shade. Under
    dry stress, canopy density can fluctuate seasonally.

  </AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Bark">
  Bark is gray-brown to dark brown, fissuring with age. Inner bark is bitter,
  reflecting limonoid chemistry associated with traditional medicinal use and
  anti-herbivory properties.
</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Leaves">
    Leaves are alternate, pinnate, and strongly serrated at leaflet edges.
    New flush can appear lighter green, maturing to medium-dark green.

  </AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Flowers">
  Neem flowers are small, white to creamy-white, sweetly fragrant, and often
  produced in panicles. Flowering can be heavy in trees with full-sun exposure
  and pronounced dry-season transition.
</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Fruit and Seeds">
    Fruits are small drupes that mature yellow to yellow-green. Seeds are
    oil-rich and are the source of most commercial neem extracts.

    <Callout type="warning">
      Raw seeds and concentrated seed oil are not general food products.
      Household storage should be clearly labeled and secured away from children

  Neem is a useful tree in Costa Rica when matched to the right place and
  purpose: hot urban shade, low-input farms, and controlled agroforestry edges.
  It should be managed with ecological humility, clear safety protocols, and
