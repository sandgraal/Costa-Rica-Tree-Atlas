allergenRisk: "low"
structuralRisks: []
childSafe: true
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "Carambola fruit is GENERALLY SAFE for most people BUT contains HIGH LEVELS OF OXALIC ACID which can be DANGEROUS for individuals with kidney disease or kidney problems. For people with HEALTHY KIDNEYS: Star fruit is safe, refreshing, and nutritious. For people with KIDNEY DISEASE (even mild kidney impairment): Star fruit can cause serious complications including confusion, seizures, and in severe cases, death. The neurotoxin caramboxin is not adequately filtered by impaired kidneys. EVEN ONE FRUIT can be dangerous for those with kidney problems. Also, star fruit can interfere with certain medications the same way grapefruit does. People taking statins, benzodiazepines, or other drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 enzyme should avoid star fruit."
safetyNotes: "For the general population with healthy kidneys, star fruit is safe and delicious. PRIMARY CONCERNS: (1) NEVER give star fruit to anyone with kidney disease or kidney problems. (2) Check medication interactions—star fruit affects drug metabolism similarly to grapefruit. (3) People with a history of kidney stones should limit consumption due to oxalate content. Symptoms of star fruit neurotoxicity include hiccups that won't stop, confusion, agitation, seizures—seek immediate medical attention if these occur after eating star fruit."
wildlifeRisks: "Generally safe for animals. No significant pet toxicity concerns like with chocolate or grapes. Oxalic acid content is not problematic for animals with normal kidney function."

plantingSeason: "Plant at start of rainy season (May-June); container plants can be planted year-round with irrigation"
maintenanceNeeds: "Moderate maintenance. Prune annually after harvest to control size and shape. Remove dead wood and crossed branches. Benefits from regular feeding - apply balanced fertilizer every 2-3 months during growing season. Watch for fruit drop if stressed. Thin fruit clusters for larger fruit size. Multiple harvests per year in Costa Rica (2-3 crops annually)."
commonProblems:
  - "Fruit flies - bag fruit or harvest promptly"
  - "Anthracnose fungal disease - prune for air circulation, fungicide if severe"
  - "Yellow leaves indicate nutrient deficiency - apply balanced fertilizer"
  - "Fruit drop from water stress - maintain consistent moisture"
  - "Scale insects on leaves and branches - spray with horticultural oil"

# Carambola (Star Fruit)

<Callout type="success" title="The Star-Shaped Wonder">
  The **Carambola** (_Averrhoa carambola_), known as Star Fruit for the perfect
  five-pointed star shape of its sliced cross-sections, is one of the most
  visually striking tropical fruits. Native to Southeast Asia, this small
  evergreen tree has found a happy home in Costa Rica's lowlands, where it
  produces waxy, golden-yellow fruits almost year-round. The refreshing, crisp
  flesh—ranging from sweet to tart depending on variety—makes carambola perfect
  for fresh eating, juices, and adding an exotic touch to salads and drinks. Few
  fruits can match its ornamental beauty both on the tree and on the plate.

    - pH 5.5-6.5
    - Warm, humid climate

    **Spacing**: 6-8 meters between trees

    **Container growing**: Possible for dwarf varieties

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Propagation">
    **Grafting** (recommended):
    - Ensures variety and quality
    - Faster fruiting (1-2 years)
    - Use seedling rootstock
    - Veneer or cleft grafts

    **From Seed**:
    - Use fresh seeds immediately
    - Germination in 1-2 weeks
    - Fruit in 4-5 years
    - Variable fruit quality

    **Air Layering**:
    - Maintains parent characteristics
    - Moderate success rate

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Care">
    **Watering Requirements**:
    - **Young trees (0-2 years)**: Water deeply 2-3 times weekly, especially during dry periods
    - **Mature trees**: Regular watering year-round—carambola is sensitive to drought
    - **Dry season**: Water 2-3 times weekly with deep soaking
    - **Rainy season**: Reduce to supplemental watering only during dry spells
    - **Critical periods**: Increase watering during flowering and fruit development
    - Apply 5-10cm of organic mulch to retain soil moisture
    - Water stress causes leaf drop and poor fruit set

    **Fertilization Schedule**:
    - **Young trees (Year 1-2)**: Apply 10-10-10 NPK every 6-8 weeks (100-200g per application)
    - **Bearing trees (Year 3+)**: Use 6-6-6-2 NPK with micronutrients 4-6 times yearly (300-600g per application)
    - **Iron supplements**: Essential—apply chelated iron (Fe-EDDHA) 2-3 times yearly if leaf yellowing occurs
    - **Timing**: Space applications evenly throughout year, increase during flush periods
    - Add compost or well-rotted manure twice yearly (10-20kg per tree)
    - Foliar spray with micronutrients (zinc, manganese, boron) 3-4 times yearly
    - **Note**: Carambola is a heavy feeder requiring consistent nutrition

    **Pruning Guidelines**:
    - **Young tree training (Years 1-3)**: Develop strong central leader with well-spaced lateral branches
    - **Annual maintenance**: Remove dead, diseased, and crossing branches after harvest
    - **Height control**: Top at 2.5-3m for easier harvesting
    - **Canopy thinning**: Remove interior growth to improve air circulation and light penetration
    - **Sucker removal**: Eliminate water sprouts and root suckers regularly
    - **Rejuvenation pruning**: Older trees benefit from moderate heading back to stimulate new growth
    - Prune lightly as carambola fruits on new growth
    - Disinfect pruning tools between cuts

    **Pest & Disease Management**:
    - **Fruit flies (Anastrepha spp.)**: Major pest—use protein baits, pheromone traps, or bag individual fruits
    - **Scale insects**: Spray with horticultural oil during crawler stage
    - **Mealybugs**: Control with insecticidal soap or beneficial insects (ladybugs)
    - **Spider mites**: Increases in dry weather—spray with water or miticides if severe
    - **Anthracnose**: Copper fungicide applications during wet periods
    - **Root rot (Phytophthora)**: Ensure excellent drainage, avoid waterlogged soil
    - **Bacterial spot**: Remove infected tissue, apply copper-based bactericide
    - Good sanitation: Remove fallen fruit and debris to reduce pest populations

    **Harvest Guidelines**:
    - Fruit ready when fully colored golden-yellow with slight browning on ridges
    - Harvest by cutting fruit with short stem attached
    - Ripe fruit pulls away easily from tree
    - Check trees every 2-3 days during peak season
    - Handle carefully—bruises easily
    - Stores 2-3 weeks refrigerated, 3-5 days at room temperature
    - Peak flavor when fully ripe on tree

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Companion Planting">
    **Beneficial Companions**:
    - **Legumes (pigeon peas, cow peas)**: Nitrogen fixation improves soil fertility for heavy-feeding carambola
    - **Pineapple**: Compatible understory crop with similar water/nutrient needs
    - **Lemongrass**: Natural pest deterrent, helps repel insects
    - **Comfrey**: Dynamic accumulator—deep roots mine nutrients, leaves make excellent mulch
    - **Marigolds & nasturtiums**: Attract beneficial insects, may help deter some pests
    - **Sweet potato**: Living groundcover that suppresses weeds

    **Compatible Fruit Trees**:
    - Other tropical fruits with similar care requirements:
      - Mango (maintain adequate spacing)
      - Citrus (similar nutrient needs)
      - Papaya (provides light shade when young)
      - Guava (compatible growth habits)

    **Plants to Avoid**:
    - Heavy shade-producing trees that would reduce fruiting
    - Plants requiring very different soil pH or drainage
    - Aggressive root competitors
    - Crops susceptible to shared pests (other Averrhoa species)

    **Intercropping Strategies**:
    - Plant nitrogen-fixing groundcovers between young trees
    - Integrate into mixed fruit orchard systems with 6-8m spacing
    - Suitable for backyard food forest systems
    - Works well in tropical homestead polyculture designs

    **Agroforestry Notes**:
    - Can be integrated into semi-intensive fruit production systems
    - Requires full sun—avoid planting under canopy trees
    - Compatible with drip irrigation systems shared with other crops

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Year-Round Care Calendar">
    **December-February (Dry Season)**:
    - Maintain consistent watering—DO NOT let tree dry out
    - Monitor for spider mites and scale (increase in dry conditions)
    - Apply iron supplements if leaf yellowing observed
    - Light pruning to shape tree

    **March-May (Transition to Rains)**:
    - Primary flowering flush begins
    - Reduce fertilization slightly to encourage fruit set
    - Monitor for fungal diseases as humidity increases
    - Protect young fruit from pests

    **June-August (Rainy Season)**:
    - Peak fruiting period for many varieties
    - Watch for anthracnose and bacterial spot
    - Apply copper fungicides if needed
    - Increase harvest frequency—check every 2-3 days

    **September-November (Late Season)**:
    - Secondary fruit flush common
    - Post-harvest fertilization to support tree recovery
    - Clean up fallen fruit and debris
    - Prepare for dry season—check irrigation system

    **Note**: Carambola can flower/fruit multiple times yearly in favorable conditions, so adjust care as needed throughout the year.
