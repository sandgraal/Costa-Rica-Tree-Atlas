# Carambola (Star Fruit)

<Callout type="success" title="The Star-Shaped Wonder">
  The **Carambola** (_Averrhoa carambola_), known as Star Fruit for the perfect
  five-pointed star shape of its sliced cross-sections, is one of the most
  visually striking tropical fruits. Native to Southeast Asia, this small
  evergreen tree has found a happy home in Costa Rica's lowlands, where it
  produces waxy, golden-yellow fruits almost year-round. The refreshing, crisp
  flesh—ranging from sweet to tart depending on variety—makes carambola perfect
  for fresh eating, juices, and adding an exotic touch to salads and drinks. Few
  fruits can match its ornamental beauty both on the tree and on the plate.
