## Physical & Botanical Description

- Medium to large evergreen tree, commonly **20-35 m** tall.
- Straight trunk with moderate buttressing in humid mature forests.
- Leaves simple, alternate, with firm texture and glossy upper surface.
- Latex-bearing tissues typical of Moraceae.
- Fruiting structures support wildlife interactions in mature forest mosaics.

---

## Geographic Distribution

<DistributionMap
  locale="en"
  countries={["Costa Rica", "Panama"]}
  elevation="0-1200 m"
/>

In Costa Rica, achotillo is associated with humid Caribbean and Pacific
rainforest landscapes, including lowland to premontane transitions.

---

## Habitat & Ecology

- Occupies humid evergreen forest and advanced secondary forest.
- Provides canopy structure, shade, and habitat continuity.
- Contributes to soil stability and watershed infiltration in high-rainfall
  basins.
- Works well in native-species enrichment for long-term restoration.

---

## Uses & Applications

### Forestry and restoration

- Native timber source in selective community forestry contexts.
- Useful for long-cycle restoration plantings in humid zones.
- Supports habitat quality in biodiversity corridors.

### Landscape and conservation value

- Appropriate for ecological parks and educational reforestation sites.
- Helps represent native Moraceae diversity in conservation plantings.

---

## Conservation Status

**IUCN Red List:** Least Concern (LC).

Despite this status, mature rainforest trees still depend on habitat continuity
and protection from deforestation and fragmentation.

---

## Growing Achotillo

1. Use fresh seed and sow in shaded nursery conditions.
2. Transplant at rainy-season onset with organic mulch.
3. Provide partial shade during juvenile establishment.
4. Reduce competing grasses and vines during first years.
5. Shift to low-intervention management once canopy is established.

Achotillo is best suited to humid restoration projects rather than dry urban
landscapes.

---

## Advanced Care Guidance

### Site Design and Planting

- Select humid lowland to premontane sites with deep, organic-rich soils and
  good drainage.
- Keep 7-10 m spacing for long-term canopy development in restoration blocks.
- Use temporary nurse shade during juvenile stages where sun and wind exposure
  are intense.

### Watering Program

- **Nursery and establishment (0-12 months):** Maintain consistently moist soil
  without waterlogging.
- **Juvenile phase (1-3 years):** Provide supplemental irrigation during long
  dry spells, especially in Caribbean foothill transition zones.
- **Established trees:** Usually rely on rainfall; irrigate only under
  exceptional drought stress.

### Fertilization Schedule

- Incorporate compost and mycorrhiza-friendly organic matter at planting.
- Apply moderate balanced nutrition (for example 12-12-17) once at early rains
  during years 1-3.
- Prioritize mulch renewal and leaf-litter cycling over frequent synthetic
  inputs in mature stands.

### Pruning and Structure

- Perform minimal formative pruning in years 1-2 to define a straight main stem.
- Remove damaged or competing low branches once canopy lift is needed.
- Avoid repeated hard pruning; this species performs best with low-intervention
  structural management.

### Pest and Disease Management

- Monitor nurseries for damping-off fungi and root stress in poorly drained
  media.
- Protect young transplants from leaf-cutter ant pressure and stem-borer damage.
- Use integrated management: sanitation, habitat balance, and targeted controls
  only when needed.

### Companion Planting

- **Recommended companions:** Guaba species, Guarumbo Hembra (as nurse), Mastate,
  and other humid-forest natives.
- **Agroforestry role:** Mid-to-upper canopy contributor in multi-strata
  rainforest restoration systems.
- **Avoid nearby:** Exposed dry-forest plantings and shallow, compacted urban
  roadside soils.

### Seasonal Care Calendar (Costa Rican Conditions)

- **Dry season (Dec-Apr):** Mulch reinforcement and moisture monitoring of
  juvenile trees.
- **Early rains (May-Jul):** Main transplant window, nutrition pulse, and weed
  release around root zone.
- **Peak rains (Aug-Oct):** Drainage surveillance, fungal checks, and low-impact
  pruning.
- **Transition (Nov):** Survival audit, gap replanting plan, and pre-dry-season
  mulch renewal.

### Growth Timeline and Management Notes

- Slow-to-moderate early growth; survival and root depth are more important than
  rapid height in years 1-3.
- Canopy integration strengthens in years 4-8 in humid forest mosaics.
- Best long-term results come from mixed-native plantings rather than isolated
  ornamental use.
