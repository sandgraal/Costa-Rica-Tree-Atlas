## Physical & Botanical Description

- Medium to large evergreen tree, commonly **20-35 m** tall.
- Straight trunk with moderate buttressing in humid mature forests.
- Leaves simple, alternate, with firm texture and glossy upper surface.
- Latex-bearing tissues typical of Moraceae.
- Fruiting structures support wildlife interactions in mature forest mosaics.

---

## Geographic Distribution

<DistributionMap
  locale="en"
  countries={["Costa Rica", "Panama"]}
  elevation="0-1200 m"
/>

In Costa Rica, achotillo is associated with humid Caribbean and Pacific
rainforest landscapes, including lowland to premontane transitions.

---

## Habitat & Ecology

- Occupies humid evergreen forest and advanced secondary forest.
- Provides canopy structure, shade, and habitat continuity.
- Contributes to soil stability and watershed infiltration in high-rainfall
  basins.
- Works well in native-species enrichment for long-term restoration.

---

## Uses & Applications

### Forestry and restoration

- Native timber source in selective community forestry contexts.
- Useful for long-cycle restoration plantings in humid zones.
- Supports habitat quality in biodiversity corridors.

### Landscape and conservation value

- Appropriate for ecological parks and educational reforestation sites.
- Helps represent native Moraceae diversity in conservation plantings.

---

## Conservation Status

**IUCN Red List:** Least Concern (LC).

Despite this status, mature rainforest trees still depend on habitat continuity
and protection from deforestation and fragmentation.

---

## Growing Achotillo

1. Use fresh seed and sow in shaded nursery conditions.
2. Transplant at rainy-season onset with organic mulch.
3. Provide partial shade during juvenile establishment.
4. Reduce competing grasses and vines during first years.
5. Shift to low-intervention management once canopy is established.

Achotillo is best suited to humid restoration projects rather than dry urban
landscapes.

---

## Advanced Care Guidance

### Site Design and Planting

- Select humid lowland to premontane sites with deep, organic-rich soils and
  good drainage.
- Keep 7-10 m spacing for long-term canopy development in restoration blocks.
- Use temporary nurse shade during juvenile stages where sun and wind exposure
  are intense.

### Watering Program

- **Nursery and establishment (0-12 months):** Maintain consistently moist soil
  without waterlogging.
- **Juvenile phase (1-3 years):** Provide supplemental irrigation during long
  dry spells, especially in Caribbean foothill transition zones.
- **Established trees:** Usually rely on rainfall; irrigate only under
  exceptional drought stress.

### Fertilization Schedule

- Incorporate compost and mycorrhiza-friendly organic matter at planting.
- Apply moderate balanced nutrition (for example 12-12-17) once at early rains
  during years 1-3.
- Prioritize mulch renewal and leaf-litter cycling over frequent synthetic
  inputs in mature stands.

### Pruning and Structure

- Perform minimal formative pruning in years 1-2 to define a straight main stem.
- Remove damaged or competing low branches once canopy lift is needed.
- Avoid repeated hard pruning; this species performs best with low-intervention
  structural management.

### Pest and Disease Management

- Monitor nurseries for damping-off fungi and root stress in poorly drained
  media.
- Protect young transplants from leaf-cutter ant pressure and stem-borer damage.
- Use integrated management: sanitation, habitat balance, and targeted controls
  only when needed.

### Companion Planting

- **Recommended companions:** Guaba species, Guarumbo Hembra (as nurse), Mastate,
  and other humid-forest natives.
- **Agroforestry role:** Mid-to-upper canopy contributor in multi-strata
  rainforest restoration systems.
- **Avoid nearby:** Exposed dry-forest plantings and shallow, compacted urban
  roadside soils.

### Seasonal Care Calendar (Costa Rican Conditions)

- **Dry season (Dec-Apr):** Mulch reinforcement and moisture monitoring of
  juvenile trees.
- **Early rains (May-Jul):** Main transplant window, nutrition pulse, and weed
  release around root zone.
- **Peak rains (Aug-Oct):** Drainage surveillance, fungal checks, and low-impact
  pruning.
- **Transition (Nov):** Survival audit, gap replanting plan, and pre-dry-season
  mulch renewal.

### Growth Timeline and Management Notes

- Slow-to-moderate early growth; survival and root depth are more important than
  rapid height in years 1-3.
- Canopy integration strengthens in years 4-8 in humid forest mosaics.
- Best long-term results come from mixed-native plantings rather than isolated
  ornamental use.

---

## Field Identification and Similar Species

### Reliable field-recognition cues

- Typically develops a straighter trunk than many fast pioneer species in the
  same humid landscapes.
- Leaves are simple and firm, with a glossy upper surface that remains evident
  even in partial shade.
- Latex presence is consistent with Moraceae handling expectations.
- Crown architecture in juvenile stages is narrower, broadening as canopy
  position improves.
- Reproductive structures are essential for high-confidence distinction from
  related regional Moraceae taxa.

/>

### Practical identification workflow

1. Confirm humid-forest context and elevation range before narrowing candidates.
2. Photograph leaves (both surfaces), branch arrangement, and bark texture.
3. Prioritize fruit/flower documentation when available for taxonomic certainty.
4. Cross-check records with reliable local references and verified observation
   platforms.
5. For restoration stock, keep nursery labels tied to seed-source documentation.

## Humid-Forest Restoration Playbook

### Enrichment planting in secondary forest

- Open small planting windows within existing regrowth rather than large clear
  cuts.
- Use achotillo as a medium-to-long horizon canopy contributor, not a quick
  visual screen.
- Keep vine and grass pressure low around planted juveniles for at least two wet
  seasons.
- Revisit each cohort after major storms to correct leaning stems early.

### Watershed and infiltration corridor projects

- Place individuals on stable microsites above chronic flood stagnation.
- Pair with complementary native trees that diversify rooting depth and canopy
  function.
- Prioritize areas that reconnect fragmented humid-forest patches.
- Use path-based monitoring routes to reduce repeated soil compaction around
  roots.

### Community forestry integration

- Align planting density with long-cycle timber and biodiversity objectives.
- Keep provenance records to support future seed-source quality and adaptation
  tracking.
- Train crews to identify juvenile stress before height growth stalls.
- Synchronize maintenance visits with rainy-season logistics to lower costs and
  improve survival outcomes.

### Nursery-to-field quality controls

- Reject root-bound seedlings before planting in restoration blocks.
- Harden seedlings under filtered light before field transfer.
- Ensure planting holes are wider than root mass and enriched with organic
  matter.
- Verify each planting event includes survival follow-up at 1, 3, and 6 months.
