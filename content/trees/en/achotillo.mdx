## Physical & Botanical Description

- Medium to large evergreen tree, commonly **20-35 m** tall.
- Straight trunk with moderate buttressing in humid mature forests.
- Leaves simple, alternate, with firm texture and glossy upper surface.
- Latex-bearing tissues typical of Moraceae.
- Fruiting structures support wildlife interactions in mature forest mosaics.

---

## Geographic Distribution

<DistributionMap
  locale="en"
  countries={["Costa Rica", "Panama"]}
  elevation="0-1200 m"
/>

In Costa Rica, achotillo is associated with humid Caribbean and Pacific
rainforest landscapes, including lowland to premontane transitions.

---

## Habitat & Ecology

- Occupies humid evergreen forest and advanced secondary forest.
- Provides canopy structure, shade, and habitat continuity.
- Contributes to soil stability and watershed infiltration in high-rainfall
  basins.
- Works well in native-species enrichment for long-term restoration.

---

## Uses & Applications

### Forestry and restoration

- Native timber source in selective community forestry contexts.
- Useful for long-cycle restoration plantings in humid zones.
- Supports habitat quality in biodiversity corridors.

### Landscape and conservation value

- Appropriate for ecological parks and educational reforestation sites.
- Helps represent native Moraceae diversity in conservation plantings.

---

## Conservation Status

**IUCN Red List:** Least Concern (LC).

Despite this status, mature rainforest trees still depend on habitat continuity
and protection from deforestation and fragmentation.

---

## Growing Achotillo

1. Use fresh seed and sow in shaded nursery conditions.
2. Transplant at rainy-season onset with organic mulch.
3. Provide partial shade during juvenile establishment.
4. Reduce competing grasses and vines during first years.
5. Shift to low-intervention management once canopy is established.

Achotillo is best suited to humid restoration projects rather than dry urban
landscapes.

---

## Where to See Achotillo in Costa Rica

- **La Selva Biological Station** and nearby Caribbean lowland forests.
- **Tortuguero conservation corridors** in humid lowlands.
- **Osa Peninsula** rainforest landscapes.
- **Golfo Dulce** watershed restoration zones.
