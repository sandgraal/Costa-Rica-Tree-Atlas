# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "none"
toxicParts: []
skinContactRisk: "none"
allergenRisk: "low"
structuralRisks: ["falling-branches", "aggressive-roots"]
childSafe: true
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "Tamarindus indica is non-toxic. The fruit pulp is widely consumed worldwide as a food ingredient, beverage base, and confection. The young leaves and flowers are also edible and used in Southeast Asian and West African cuisines. Seeds are edible when roasted or boiled and are processed commercially for tamarind seed gum and powder. No toxic compounds have been identified in the fruit, leaves, or seeds at normal consumption levels. The bark and root extracts have been used traditionally in medicine. While the fruit is acidic (tartaric acid), this is a culinary characteristic, not a toxicity concern."
skinContactDetails: "No skin contact risk. The bark, leaves, and fruit do not contain irritant compounds. The sticky fruit pulp can stain hands brown but causes no irritation. The wood dust from sawing is non-irritating (unlike many tropical hardwoods). The tree produces no latex or caustic sap. Safe to handle without protective equipment."
allergenDetails: "Low allergen risk. Tamarind pollen is primarily insect-dispersed and produced in modest quantities. The protein profile of tamarind fruit is not associated with common food allergens, though rare individual sensitivities are possible with any food. Cross-reactivity with other legume allergens is theoretically possible but not documented as a clinical concern. Tamarind is widely consumed globally with very few allergy reports."
structuralRiskDetails: "Large mature tamarinds can develop heavy lateral branches that may break during storms or high winds, particularly if weakened by decay or termite damage. The extensive root system can lift sidewalks and interfere with underground pipes if planted too close to structures. Plant at least 10 meters from buildings and infrastructure. Old hollow trunks should be assessed by an arborist. Falling pods during fruiting season are harmless but can create litter."
safetyNotes: "The Sweet Tamarind is a safe, family-friendly tree. The fruit is a beloved food consumed by children throughout the tropics. There are no toxicity concerns for humans or animals. The main safety consideration is the large size at maturity — give the tree ample space and be aware of potential branch drop in storms. Fallen pods can be slippery underfoot when wet. An excellent shade tree for parks, schoolyards, and large gardens."
wildlifeRisks: "Non-toxic to all wildlife and domestic animals. Fruit is consumed by birds, bats, monkeys, and other mammals. The foliage provides browse for livestock (cattle, goats). Seeds are consumed by parrots and rodents. The tree is widely used as livestock fodder throughout the tropics with no adverse effects."

## Overview

_Tamarindus indica_, known in Costa Rica as Tamarindo or Tamarindo Dulce, is one of the most important fruit trees in the tropical world. The sole species in its genus, this massive, long-lived legume tree has been cultivated across the tropics for millennia for its distinctively flavored fruit pods.

The standard tamarind produces fruit with a sharp, intensely tart flavor — an acquired taste beloved in many cuisines. The sweet tamarind varieties (_dulcis_ or _dulce_ selections), however, produce fruit with significantly reduced tartaric acid content and higher sugar levels, making the pulp more immediately palatable — sweet with a pleasant tang, somewhat like a date crossed with an apricot. These sweet varieties are the ones most commonly cultivated in Costa Rican home gardens.

In Costa Rica, the tamarind is an iconic tree of the Pacific lowlands, particularly Guanacaste province, where it thrives in the hot, dry conditions that characterize northwestern Costa Rica. The city of Santa Cruz in Guanacaste is legendary for its tamarind trees, and the fruit is deeply embedded in local food culture. **Agua de tamarindo** — a refreshing drink made by soaking tamarind pulp in water with sugar — is a staple beverage found at every soda (local restaurant) and home kitchen in the country. Tamarind paste and candy are also widely enjoyed.

The tree itself is architecturally magnificent. A mature tamarind develops a massive, symmetrical, hemispherical crown that can spread 15–25 meters, creating dense shade that is cooler than the shade of most tropical trees due to the fine, feathery pinnate foliage. The trunk can reach 1.5 meters in diameter, with rugged, deeply fissured bark. Old tamarinds are among the most impressive trees in any tropical landscape, and individual specimens can live 200–400 years.

As a member of the Fabaceae (legume family), the tamarind has nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules, improving soil fertility wherever it grows. This makes it an excellent agroforestry tree, historically planted in pastures throughout Guanacaste to provide shade for cattle while enriching the soil.

### Taxonomic Notes

_Tamarindus indica_ is the sole species in the genus _Tamarindus_ — it has no close relatives. The genus occupies an isolated position within the Detarioideae subfamily of legumes. Despite its species name _indica_ (suggesting Indian origin), the tree is now considered native to tropical Africa, particularly the savanna regions of Sudan, Cameroon, and East Africa. It was introduced to India in antiquity (likely before 5000 BCE) and became so thoroughly naturalized that European botanists originally believed it was of Indian origin. The sweet tamarind varieties are not a distinct variety or subspecies but rather selected cultivars with reduced tartaric acid content.

## Physical Description

### Growth Form

The Sweet Tamarind is a large, slow-growing, semi-deciduous tree. At maturity, it develops one of the most impressive canopies of any tropical tree — a dense, rounded, hemispherical crown that can spread 15–25 meters. The form is often broader than it is tall, creating a massive umbrella of shade. The branching pattern is dense and twisting, with secondary branches drooping gracefully under their own weight.

### Trunk and Bark

The trunk is massive, straight or slightly sinuous, reaching up to 1.5 meters in diameter in old specimens. The bark is dark gray to blackish-brown, deeply fissured and rough, developing an attractive scaly texture with age. The wood is extremely hard, dense (specific gravity 0.8–0.9), and durable, with a beautiful reddish-brown heartwood that takes a fine polish — prized for woodworking but rarely harvested due to the tree's greater value as a fruit producer.

### Leaves

The leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, 10–15 cm long, with 10–20 pairs of small, oblong leaflets each 1–2.5 cm long and 5–8 mm wide. The leaflets fold closed at night (nyctinastic movement) and during cloudy weather — a characteristic behavior of many legumes. This gives the tree a soft, feathery appearance by day that transforms into a drooping, closed aspect at dusk. Young foliage is bright green, maturing to a darker green.

### Flowers

The flowers are small (2–3 cm) but attractive, appearing in loose racemes at branch tips. Each flower has 3 well-developed petals that are yellow with red or orange veining, giving the inflorescences a warm, ornamental appearance. Flowering occurs during the dry season (March–May in Costa Rica), often triggered by water stress after a period of drought. The flowers are fragrant and attract bees, which are the primary pollinators.

### Fruit and Seeds

The fruit is the tamarind's defining feature — an elongated, curved pod, 7–20 cm long and 2–3 cm wide, with a brittle, brown shell that cracks easily to reveal the edible pulp within. The pulp of sweet varieties is soft, sticky, dark brown to reddish-brown, with a sweet-tangy flavor and date-like texture. Each pod contains 4–12 hard, smooth, angular, brown seeds embedded in the pulp. The seeds are covered in a thin, red-brown seed coat and surrounded by fibers. Pods hang in clusters of 10–50, often remaining on the tree for months after maturation.

In Costa Rica, the Sweet Tamarind is most abundant in the Pacific lowlands:

- **Guanacaste**: The heartland of tamarind culture in Costa Rica. Enormous old trees shade town plazas in Santa Cruz, Nicoya, Liberia, and Filadelfia. The dry climate is ideal.
- **Puntarenas**: Common throughout the Pacific coast lowlands from Puntarenas city to the Nicoya Peninsula.
- **Central Valley**: Cultivated in warmer areas of San José, Alajuela, and Grecia at lower elevations.
- **Northern Zone**: Scattered plantings in the warm lowlands around Cañas and Tilarán.

The species is uncommon on the Caribbean slope, where the consistently wet climate is less suitable than the seasonal dryness of the Pacific side.

### Broader Distribution

_Tamarindus indica_ is now pantropical, cultivated in tropical regions worldwide. Major producers include India (world's largest), Thailand (leading producer of sweet varieties), Mexico, Philippines, Bangladesh, and East African nations. The tree has become naturalized throughout Central America, the Caribbean, and coastal South America. It thrives wherever there are warm temperatures and a distinct dry season.

  ]}
/>

### Ecological Role

Although introduced, the tamarind has become ecologically integrated into Costa Rican landscapes over centuries:

- **Shade provider**: The dense canopy creates microclimates that support shade-dependent understory plants, reduce soil evaporation, and lower ambient temperatures by 5-10°C
- **Nitrogen fixation**: As a legume, the tree harbors Rhizobium bacteria in root nodules, enriching soil with atmospheric nitrogen
- **Pollinator resource**: Flowers provide nectar and pollen for native bees and introduced honeybees during the dry season — a critical resource when few other trees are flowering
- **Wildlife food**: Fruit consumed by white-faced capuchins, howler monkeys, coatis, squirrels, parakeets, and many other species
- **Bat roost**: Large old tamarinds with cavities provide roosting sites for bats

### Environmental Adaptations

The tamarind is remarkably well-adapted to dry tropical environments:

- **Leaf closure**: Leaflets fold at night and during drought to reduce water loss (nyctinastic and drought-responsive movements)
- **Deep root system**: Extensive taproot and lateral roots access deep soil moisture
- **Semi-deciduous**: May shed some leaves during severe drought, reducing transpiration
- **Dense wood**: Hard, dense wood resists wind damage in storms
- **Fire resistance**: Thick bark protects against savanna fires in native habitat

## Cultural and Historical Significance

The tamarind is one of the most culturally significant trees in the tropical world, with a history spanning thousands of years across multiple civilizations.

### In Costa Rica

The tamarind is deeply embedded in Guanacastecan culture. The enormous old tamarinds in town plazas throughout Guanacaste and the Nicoya Peninsula are social landmarks — generations have gathered under their shade for markets, festivals, dances, and conversation. The phrase "bajo el tamarindo" (under the tamarind) evokes a sense of community, leisure, and traditional rural life in Costa Rica.

Agua de tamarindo is one of the "aguas frescas" (fresh waters) that define Costa Rican beverage culture, alongside horchata, cas, and chan. It is served at virtually every meal in Guanacaste and is a fixture at fiestas, bullfights, and community celebrations.

### Global Significance

- **India**: The tamarind is considered sacred in Hindu tradition and features in religious ceremonies, Ayurvedic medicine, and every regional cuisine
- **Thailand**: Thailand leads the world in sweet tamarind production; the fruit is a national snack
- **Arabic World**: The English name "tamarind" derives from the Arabic **تمر هندي** (tamar hindi, "Indian date")
- **Africa**: Wild tamarind groves in the Sudan-Sahel zone provide critical food security during dry seasons
- **Mexico**: Tamarind candy (pulparindo) is one of Mexico's most popular confections

---

## Conservation Status

<Callout type="success" title="Least Concern">
  Tamarindus indica is classified as **Least Concern (LC)** by the IUCN. As one
  of the most widely cultivated fruit trees in the tropics, the species faces no
  global threat. Wild populations exist across tropical Africa, and the tree is
  extensively naturalized throughout Asia, the Americas, and the Pacific. In
  Costa Rica, it is a common cultivated tree requiring no conservation
  intervention.
</Callout>

### Conservation Notes

While the species itself is secure, some concerns exist:

- **Genetic erosion**: Sweet varieties are often propagated clonally, narrowing the genetic base
- **Old-growth loss**: Centuries-old tamarinds in towns and plazas are threatened by development and infrastructure projects
- **Wild population monitoring**: African wild populations in some regions face pressure from land clearing

---

## Growing the Sweet Tamarind

### Site Selection

The Sweet Tamarind requires:

- **Full sun** — minimum 8 hours direct sunlight daily
- **Warm climate** — lowland areas below 1,000 m elevation in Costa Rica
- **Well-drained soil** — tolerates most soil types but avoid waterlogged conditions
- **Ample space** — this is a large tree! Allow a minimum of 12 meters from buildings, utilities, and other trees
- **Dry season** — performs best in areas with a distinct dry season (Pacific slope)

Guanacaste and the Central Pacific coast provide ideal conditions.

### Propagation

**From Seed**: Seeds germinate readily in 1-2 weeks without pretreatment. However, seedlings from sweet tamarind parents may not produce equally sweet fruit — there is significant genetic variation. Seedlings take 6-8 years to fruit.

**Grafting**: The preferred method for ensuring fruit quality. Side-veneer or approach grafting onto seedling rootstock produces trees true to the desired variety, fruiting in 3-4 years. Select scion wood from known sweet-fruiting, heavy-bearing trees.

**Air Layering**: Effective on mature branches; produces fruiting-size trees in 2-3 years. Particularly useful for replicating exceptional sweet varieties.

### Planting and Care

- Plant in a large hole (60 × 60 cm) enriched with compost and bone meal
- Water regularly during the first 2-3 dry seasons
- Mulch heavily to conserve moisture for young trees
- Structural pruning in the first 3-5 years to develop a strong central leader and well-spaced scaffold branches
- No regular fertilization needed for mature trees due to nitrogen fixation
- Harvest pods when they are brown, dry, and separate easily from the shell

### Care Calendar

    ],
    [
      "November-December",
      "Dry season begins; pods ready for harvest; begin harvesting mature brown pods",
    ],
  ]}
/>

### Companion Planting

The tamarind pairs well with:

- **Beneficial companions**: Pasture grasses and cattle (traditional silvopastoral system in Guanacaste); nitrogen-fixing understory legumes; shade-loving crops like coffee (at appropriate elevations)
- **Compatible trees**: Guanacaste tree, mango, jocote, nance — traditional Guanacaste agroforestry combination
- **Plants for understory**: Shade-tolerant ornamentals, ginger, turmeric under mature canopy
- **Caution**: The dense shade and extensive roots can suppress nearby crops — plant shade-intolerant species well away from the canopy drip line

---

## Where to See the Sweet Tamarind

### In Costa Rica

- **Santa Cruz, Guanacaste**: Legendary tamarind trees in town plazas and streets — some several centuries old
- **Nicoya**: Historic trees in the central park and surrounding areas
- **Liberia**: Park and roadside trees throughout the city
- **Puntarenas city**: Large specimens along the coastal promenade
- **Any Pacific lowland town**: Look for massive, spreading shade trees in parks and plazas

### Best Viewing Season

The tamarind is most interesting during:

- **March–May**: Flowering season — delicate yellow and red flowers against the feathery foliage
- **December–March**: Fruiting season — heavy clusters of brown pods hang from branches
- **Year-round**: The architectural form and dense shade canopy are impressive at any time
