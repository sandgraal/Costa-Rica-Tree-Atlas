toxicityDetails: "Capulín (Jamaica Cherry) is COMPLETELY NON-TOXIC and SAFE. The fruit, leaves, and flowers are not known to be toxic to humans or animals. The fruit is beloved by children and commonly called 'candy tree' or 'cotton candy berry' - specifically safe for kids. CHILDREN can safely eat the abundant sweet red berries fresh, in jams, or drinks without concern. PETS: Birds, squirrels, and wildlife frequently eat the fruit. No documented toxic effects for domesticated pets (dogs, cats) from the fruit, though moderation is advised as with any new food. The tree is unarmed (no spines/thorns/burrs) and poses no mechanical risks. EDIBILITY: Small red or yellow berries are sweet, musky, soft - eaten raw or processed. EXCEPTIONAL SAFETY PROFILE for both humans and animals."
skinContactDetails: "No skin irritation risk from contact with any part of the tree. Leaves, flowers, fruit, and bark do not cause dermatitis or allergic reactions. Completely safe to touch and handle without protective equipment."
allergenDetails: "NO allergen risk documented. No evidence of allergies or irritations from consuming fruit or handling plant parts. The fruit is widely consumed without allergic reactions. Overall allergen risk: NONE."
safetyNotes: "Capulín is an EXCEPTIONALLY SAFE fruit tree perfect for families, schools, parks, and urban areas. ZERO toxicity concerns - completely safe for children and pets. EDIBLE FRUIT: The abundant sweet berries are nutritious and loved by children throughout Central America. Often called the 'sidewalk tree' or 'candy tree' because children pick and eat fruit directly from trees growing in urban areas without supervision - this demonstrates extreme safety. TRADITIONAL MEDICINE: Leaves used for headaches, gastric ulcers, as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant (safe). Flowers have antiseptic/antispasmodic qualities for teas and cramps (safe). Fruit rich in antioxidants with antibacterial and anticancer properties being researched. WILDLIFE VALUE: Birds and animals distribute seeds, supporting ecosystems. ONLY CONCERN: Large quantities may cause mild digestive upset for some (like any berries - diarrhea if overconsumed), especially in very young children, but NO acute toxicity. ENVIRONMENTAL NOTE: Can become invasive in some tropical regions (gardening concern, not safety issue). PERFECT CHOICE for edible landscaping, schools, and family gardens - provides safe, nutritious fruit for people and wildlife."

# Capulín (Jamaica Cherry / Panama Berry)

<Callout type="success" title="The Street Corner Fruit Tree">
  The **Capulín** (_Muntingia calabura_), known throughout the Americas as
  Jamaica Cherry, Panama Berry, or Strawberry Tree, is perhaps the most
  successful pioneer fruit tree in the tropical world. This small but prolific
  tree seems to grow anywhere—from vacant lots and roadsides to cracks in
  concrete—and produces thousands of small, sweet red berries year-round. For
  generations of Costa Rican children, the Capulín has been a source of free
  snacks, its low-hanging branches laden with ripe fruit just waiting to be
  picked.

## The Fruit

### Characteristics

<FeatureBox title="Capulín Berries" icon="🍒">
  **Appearance**:
  - Tiny round berries, 1-1.5 cm
  - Green when immature
  - Yellow transitioning to bright red when ripe
  - Soft, easily squashed when fully ripe

**Flavor Profile**:

- Sweet with slight musky undertone
- Often compared to cotton candy or fig

</FeatureBox>

### How to Enjoy

<Callout type="tip" title="Picking Tips">
  **Ripeness**: Pick when deep red and slightly soft to touch. If it falls off easily into your hand, it's perfect!

**Best Practice**:

- Eat immediately—they don't store well
- Can be made into jam (lots needed!)
- Birds love them, so you may have competition
- Avoid stained clothing—the juice is persistent

  - Can become "weedy" in ideal conditions

**From Cuttings**:

- Semi-hardwood cuttings work
- Root in 4-6 weeks
- Faster to fruit than seedlings

**Care**:

- Minimal care needed once established
- Tolerates poor soil
- Pruning optional but helps shape
- First fruit: 1-2 years from seed

</FeatureBox>

## Cultural Significance

<Callout type="leaf" title="Children's Tree">
  Throughout Latin America, the Capulín holds a special place in childhood
  memories. Its low branches, accessible fruit, and year-round production make
  it the quintessential "kid's fruit tree." Many Costa Ricans can recall
  climbing Capulín trees as children, hands and faces stained red with berry
  juice—a universal tropical childhood experience.

    ["Malpighia emarginata", "Acerola", "Similar fruit appearance"],
  ]}
/>

---

## Conservation Status

<Callout type="info" title="Conservation Notes">
  **IUCN Status**: Least Concern (LC)

The Capulín faces no conservation threats. In fact, it's so successful that it's considered invasive in some Pacific islands and parts of Asia where it was introduced. Its prolific seeding, fast growth, and bird-dispersed seeds make it an aggressive colonizer.

**In Costa Rica**: The Capulín is a welcome native pioneer, valued for its role in urban ecology and forest restoration. No protection measures are needed.

_The Capulín (Muntingia calabura) embodies the spirit of tropical resilience—a tree that asks for nothing but gives abundantly. Whether growing from a crack in a city sidewalk or colonizing a cleared pasture, it provides shade, food, and habitat for wildlife. This humble tree reminds us that nature finds a way, even in the most challenging environments._
