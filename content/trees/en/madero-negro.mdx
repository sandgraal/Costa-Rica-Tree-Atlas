# Madero Negro (Madre de Cacao)

<Callout type="success" title="The Ultimate Multipurpose Tree">
  **Madero Negro** (_Gliricidia sepium_), also known as **Madre de Cacao** or
  **Quick Stick**, is perhaps the most useful tree in Central American
  agroforestry. Fast-growing, easily propagated from large cuttings,
  nitrogen-fixing, and producing excellent fodder, shade, and fuel—it has been
  cultivated alongside agriculture for thousands of years. During dry season,
  its spectacular **pink-magenta flower display** transforms the countryside,
  making it one of the most beautiful as well as practical trees in Costa Rica.

## Physical Description

### General Form

Madero Negro is a small to medium deciduous tree with an open, spreading crown. Multiple trunks often arise from the base, creating a bushy habit. The tree is deciduous, losing its leaves in dry season and blooming spectacularly before new leaves emerge.

## Ecological Importance

### Nitrogen Fixation

<Callout type="success" title="Soil Building Powerhouse">
  As a legume, Madero Negro hosts nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules:
  - **Fixes**: 100-250+ kg N/ha/year in good conditions - **Mechanism**:
  Symbiotic Rhizobium bacteria - **Benefit**: Enriches soil, reduces fertilizer
  needs - **Leaf Litter**: Decomposes rapidly, releasing nutrients -
  **Prunings**: Can be used as green manure This makes it invaluable in
  sustainable agricultural systems.
</Callout>

### Wildlife Interactions

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Pollinators

- **Bees**: Primary pollinators—Africanized bees, stingless bees
- **Butterflies**: Visit flowers
- **Other Insects**: Various visitors
- **Honey Production**: Important bee forage

#### Seed Dispersal

- **Mechanism**: Pods dehisce (split open)
- **Gravity**: Seeds fall near parent
- **Human**: Widely planted, propagated

</Column>
<Column>

#### Ecosystem Services

- **Shade**: Reduces temperatures under canopy
- **Windbreak**: Protects crops
- **Erosion Control**: Root system stabilizes soil
- **Soil Improvement**: N-fixation + organic matter
- **Carbon Sequestration**: Fast growth captures carbon

#### Wildlife Habitat

- **Nesting**: Birds use for nest sites
- **Perching**: Raptors, parrots use bare branches
- **Cover**: General wildlife shelter

## Agroforestry Uses

### Living Fences

<FeatureBox title="The Perfect Living Fence" icon="🌱">
  Madero Negro is probably the world's most-used living fence species: -
  **Propagation**: Large cuttings (estacas) 1.5-2.5 m long - **Establishment**:
  Plant directly in ground during rainy season - **Root Strike**: 80-100%
  success rate - **Wire Attachment**: Barbed wire stapled directly to trunk -
  **Lifespan**: 30+ years with proper management - **Benefits**: Fence posts
  that grow, don't rot, produce fodder In Guanacaste, living fences of Madero
  Negro define virtually every pasture and property boundary.

<Callout type="success" title="The Farmer's Best Friend">
  Madero Negro represents the perfect integration of trees into tropical
  farming. It asks little—stick a cutting in the ground—and gives much: fence
  posts that don't rot, shade that fertilizes your crops, fodder for your
  cattle, firewood for your kitchen. For millennia, Central American farmers
  have known this, and now the rest of the tropics benefits too. Next time you
  see a pink-blooming fence line in Guanacaste, appreciate this remarkable tree
  that makes sustainable agriculture possible.
