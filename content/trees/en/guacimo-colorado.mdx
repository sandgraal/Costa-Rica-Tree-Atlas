toxicParts: []
skinContactRisk: "none"
allergenRisk: "low"
structuralRisks: []
childSafe: true
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "No known toxicity. The bark has traditional medicinal uses as an astringent with no reported adverse effects at normal doses. All parts of the tree are considered safe."
skinContactDetails: "No skin irritation reported. The young shoots produce a mucilaginous substance when macerated in water, which is used in traditional sugar processing - this is safe to handle."
allergenDetails: "Low allergen risk. As with most tropical hardwoods, wood dust may cause mild respiratory irritation in woodworkers during extended processing. Standard dust protection is recommended when working with the wood."
safetyNotes: "Guácimo Colorado is a safe tree for planting in parks, gardens, and natural areas. No toxicity concerns for children or pets. The tree provides excellent shade and is often planted as an amenity tree. The large buttressed trunk is a notable landscape feature."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "fast"
growthRateDetails: "Fast-growing species that can flower even when still at shrub stage; young plants in open areas may have much larger juvenile leaves (up to 30 cm); reaches impressive canopy heights in mature forest"
matureSize: "30-40 m tall (tallest specimens on Atlantic coast of Costa Rica), trunk 60-180 cm diameter with buttresses up to 2 m high; impressive canopy tree"
hardiness: "Tropical wet lowland forests; 0-600m elevation; prefers humid conditions; best growth near streams and in wet lowland forest; tolerates hilly areas"
soilRequirements: "Grows wild in a wide range of soils; prefers well-drained alluvial soils; tolerates various soil types in its native range"
waterNeeds: "high"
waterDetails: "Prefers wet conditions. Found naturally in areas with 2,000-4,000 mm annual rainfall. Best growth near streams and in wet lowland forests. Does not tolerate prolonged drought."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plant 15-20 m from buildings due to large mature size; suitable for parks and large properties; needs space for buttresses to develop"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
propagationDifficulty: "moderate"
plantingSeason: "Plant at start of rainy season (May-June); seeds should be sown fresh for best results"
maintenanceNeeds: "LOW maintenance once established. Large canopy tree - select appropriate site for mature size. Years 1-3: water regularly during establishment, protect from competition. Mature trees: self-maintaining, impressive shade tree. Buttresses develop naturally and should not be removed."

# Guácimo Colorado

<Callout type="info" title="The Red-Backed Canopy Giant">
  **Guácimo Colorado** (_Luehea seemannii_), named for the distinctive rusty-red
  (colorado) undersides of its leaves, is one of the most impressive canopy
  trees in Costa Rica's wet lowland forests. Reaching heights of up to 40 meters
  on the Atlantic coast, this fast-growing member of the mallow family develops
  spectacular buttresses and hosts an extraordinary diversity of insect life—a
  study in Panama found nearly 1,000 species of beetles on a single tree! While
  sharing the "Guácimo" name with _Guazuma ulmifolia_, these are quite different
  trees in appearance and ecology.

## Physical Description

### Overall Form

Guácimo Colorado is an impressive evergreen canopy tree that can reach exceptional heights, particularly on Costa Rica's Atlantic coast. The trunk develops prominent buttresses, and the crown forms a dense, spreading canopy high in the forest.

- **Form**: Straight bole reaching canopy

#### Leaves

- **Size**: 10-20 cm (juveniles up to 30 cm!)

- **Lower surface**: Distinctive rusty-red, tomentose (felty)
- **Arrangement**: Alternate

</Column>
<Column>

#### Flowers

- **Color**: White to cream
- **Size**: Medium-sized

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

<Callout type="tip" title="Field Identification Tip">
  The easiest way to identify Guácimo Colorado is by the **rusty-red,
  felty-textured undersides of the leaves** (colorado means "red" or "colored"
  in Spanish). Young plants in pastures or cut-over land may have much larger
  juvenile leaves—up to 30 cm long—making this feature even more pronounced.
  Look for the large buttresses on mature forest trees.

  A landmark study in the Panama Canal Zone by Terry L. Erwin and Janice C.
  Scott (1980) found an astounding **945 species of beetles** on a single
  Guácimo Colorado tree! This exceptional insect diversity demonstrates the
  tree's importance as habitat for invertebrate communities in tropical forests.
  The tree's large size, complex bark structure, and persistent dead branches
  provide microhabitats for countless insect species.

## Cultural & Economic Importance

### Traditional Uses

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Medicine

The bark has been used traditionally as an astringent in folk medicine. A decoction of the bark is taken internally for its astringent properties.

#### Sugar Processing

In traditional small-scale sugarcane processing (trapiches), the macerated young shoots produce a brown-reddish mucilaginous substance when soaked in water. This substance is used to help agglomerate dirt and debris from boiling sugarcane juice. The collected debris is then used as fertilizer.

</Column>
<Column>

#### Wood Uses

The wood of _Luehea_ species has the following characteristics:

- **Color**: Brown to brownish, sometimes pinkish-streaked
- **Texture**: Fine to medium
- **Grain**: Straight to finely roey
- **Weight**: Soft and light
- **Durability**: Not very durable (vulnerable to decay and insects)

Primary use is for **firewood**. Also used for low-value items such as:

- Millwork and furniture components
- Flooring and general construction
- Boxes and crates
- Veneer and plywood

## Conservation Status

    { label: "IUCN Red List", value: "Least Concern (LC)" },

  ]}
/>

### Conservation Notes

<Callout type="info" title="Least Concern But Habitat-Dependent">
  While Guácimo Colorado is assessed as Least Concern due to its wide range and
  stable populations, it is habitat-dependent on **wet lowland forests**—one of
  the most threatened ecosystem types in Central America due to agricultural
  expansion. The species' inability to tolerate dry conditions limits its
  distribution to increasingly fragmented wet forest patches. Conservation
  priorities include protection of remaining wet lowland forests, inclusion in
  reforestation projects in wet zones, and corridor plantings connecting forest
  fragments.

<Callout type="tip" title="A Living Insect Museum">
  Guácimo Colorado reminds us that trees are not just trees—they are entire
  ecosystems. The discovery of nearly 1,000 beetle species on a single tree
  helped revolutionize our understanding of tropical biodiversity. When you see
  a Guácimo Colorado towering above the forest with its distinctive buttresses
  and rusty-backed leaves, you're looking at a skyscraper of insect apartments,
  a pharmacy of traditional remedies, and an integral part of wet lowland forest
  ecology. Protecting these impressive trees means protecting the countless
  species that depend on them.
