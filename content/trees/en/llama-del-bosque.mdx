### Taxonomic Notes

_Spathodea campanulata_ is the only species in the genus _Spathodea_, endemic to tropical Africa. The genus name derives from the Greek "spathe" (blade), referring to the boat-shaped calyx. The species epithet "campanulata" means "bell-shaped," describing the flower form.

First described by Palisot de Beauvois in 1805, the tree has been widely distributed throughout the tropics for its ornamental value, becoming naturalized (and invasive) in many regions far from its native range.

### Etymology

- **Spathodea**: From Greek "spathe" (blade/sword), referring to the spathe-like calyx
- **campanulata**: Latin for "bell-shaped," describing the campanulate (bell-shaped) flowers

## Physical/Botanical Description

### Tree Form

The African tulip tree is a large, fast-growing evergreen or semi-deciduous tree reaching 10-35 meters in height. It develops a straight, cylindrical trunk up to 1 meter in diameter and a dense, rounded to spreading crown. Young trees have a pyramidal shape that broadens with age.

The tree is notable for its rapid growth rate - it can add 1-2 meters of height per year under favorable conditions, reaching 10-15 meters in just 5-7 years. This aggressive growth contributes to its invasive character.

### Bark

The bark is smooth and pale gray to greenish on young trees, becoming darker gray-black, rougher, and vertically fissured with age. The bark exfoliates in thin plates. When damaged, the bark may exude a slight sticky sap but it is not milky like some tropical trees.

### Leaves

<PropertiesGrid>
  <PropertyCard
    icon="🍃"
    label="Arrangement"
    value="Opposite, pinnately compound"
  />
  <PropertyCard icon="📏" label="Size" value="Compound leaves 30-50 cm long" />
  <PropertyCard
    icon="✨"
    label="Leaflets"
    value="5-9 pairs plus terminal leaflet"
  />
  <PropertyCard icon="🌿" label="Type" value="Evergreen, glossy" />
</PropertiesGrid>

The leaves are opposite and pinnately compound (feather-like), consisting of 5-9 pairs of leaflets plus a terminal leaflet, for a total of 11-19 leaflets per leaf. Individual leaflets are oval to oblong, 6-15 cm long and 3-7 cm wide, with entire margins and an acute to acuminate tip.

Leaflets are dark green and glossy on the upper surface, paler beneath, with a prominent midrib. The leaf rachis (main axis) is 30-50 cm long. New growth emerges bronze-colored before turning green.

The foliage is dense, providing heavy shade beneath the crown.

### Flowers

<PropertiesGrid>
  <PropertyCard
    icon="🌸"
    label="Color"
    value="Orange-red to scarlet (rarely yellow)"
  />
  <PropertyCard icon="📏" label="Size" value="10-12 cm long, tulip-shaped" />
  <PropertyCard icon="🌿" label="Arrangement" value="Terminal racemes" />
  <PropertyCard icon="📅" label="Season" value="Year-round (peak Feb-June)" />
</PropertiesGrid>

The flowers are the tree's most spectacular feature and the reason for its popularity as an ornamental. They are large (10-12 cm long), tulip-shaped, and brilliantly colored in shades of orange-red to deep scarlet. Rarely, trees produce yellow flowers (var. _lutea_).

Flowers are borne in dense terminal racemes (clusters) of 20-40 flowers at branch tips. The calyx is boat-shaped (spathe-like), brown, and splits on one side as the flower emerges. The corolla has five lobes that curl back at the tips, forming the characteristic tulip shape.

**Unique Feature**: Flower buds contain water, which can be squirted out when squeezed - a source of play for children in tropical regions (though this should be discouraged given the tree's problems).

Flowers are **zygomorphic** (bilateral symmetry) with a curved tube. The nectar attracts hummingbirds, which are the primary pollinators. **WARNING**: The nectar is toxic to some bee species.

Flowering can occur year-round in tropical Costa Rica, with peak blooming from February through June. Young trees begin flowering at 3-4 years old, sometimes earlier.

### Fruit & Seeds

The fruit is a large, woody, boat-shaped capsule (pod), 15-25 cm long and 3-4 cm wide, brown when mature. The pod splits along two sutures to release the seeds.

Each pod contains **200-500 flat, papery, winged seeds** that are dispersed by wind. This prolific seed production (a single tree can produce thousands of seeds annually) is a major factor in the species' invasiveness. The seeds are lightweight and can be carried long distances by wind.

**WARNING**: Seeds are poisonous. In Africa, they are boiled to create arrow poison.

</PropertiesGrid>

### Native Distribution

The African tulip tree is native to tropical Africa, with its natural range extending from Senegal and Sierra Leone in West Africa eastward to Ethiopia, and south through Angola, Tanzania, and Uganda. In its native range, it is a component of lowland tropical rainforests and gallery forests.

### Introduced Distribution (Global)

The tree has been widely introduced to tropical and subtropical regions worldwide for ornamental purposes:

- **Americas**: Caribbean islands, Central America, northern South America, southern Mexico, southern Florida
- **Asia**: India, Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, southern China
- **Pacific**: Hawaii, Fiji, Samoa, Australia (Queensland), Papua New Guinea

In many of these regions, it has naturalized and become invasive.

### Distribution in Costa Rica (Introduced)

African tulip tree is now found throughout Costa Rica, particularly in:

- **Urban Areas**: Common street tree in San José, Alajuela, Heredia, Cartago
- **Disturbed Habitats**: Roadsides, pastures, abandoned fields, forest edges
- **All Provinces**: Present in all seven provinces, from sea level to 1500 m
- **Naturalized Populations**: Spreading in disturbed forest areas, particularly in humid lowland and premontane zones

The tree was introduced as an ornamental in the early-mid 20th century and has spread extensively through seed dispersal.

### Invasive Status in Costa Rica

**HIGHLY INVASIVE**: The African tulip tree is recognized as a problematic invasive species in Costa Rica. It:

- Colonizes disturbed sites rapidly
- Forms dense thickets that exclude native vegetation
- Reproduces both by seed and root suckers
- Is difficult to eradicate once established
- Threatens native forest regeneration
- Is spreading into protected areas

  <PropertyCard
    icon="🪨"
    label="Soil"
    value="Adaptable; prefers moist, fertile"
  />
</PropertiesGrid>

### Ecological Role (Invasive)

As an invasive species, the African tulip tree has **negative ecological impacts** in Costa Rica:

1. **Displaces Native Species**: Forms dense stands that shade out native trees and prevent forest regeneration
2. **Alters Soil Chemistry**: Deep litter layer may change soil properties
3. **Harms Native Pollinators**: Nectar is toxic to some native bee species
4. **Reduces Biodiversity**: Areas dominated by African tulip have lower plant diversity

### Habitat Preferences

The tree is highly adaptable but thrives in:

- **Disturbed Sites**: Roadsides, abandoned agricultural land, forest edges
- **Moist Habitats**: Areas with consistent rainfall or seasonal wetness
- **Open to Partial Canopy**: Fast-growing pioneer species that requires light
- **Lowland to Mid-Elevations**: Most common below 1000 m but found up to 1500 m

The tree is **shade-tolerant as a seedling**, allowing it to persist under forest canopy, but requires light to grow rapidly and reach the canopy.

### Reproduction and Spread

The invasive success of _S. campanulata_ is due to:

1. **Prolific Seed Production**: Thousands of wind-dispersed seeds per tree annually
2. **High Germination Rate**: Seeds germinate readily on bare soil
3. **Vegetative Reproduction**: Produces root suckers that form new trees
4. **Fast Growth**: Quickly reaches reproductive age (3-4 years)
5. **Adaptability**: Tolerates various soil and moisture conditions

</PropertiesGrid>

### Historical and Current Uses

**Ornamental**: The tree has been widely planted as a street tree and garden specimen for its spectacular flowers. However, its invasive nature has led to a reevaluation of this use.

**Shade**: Provides dense shade with its broad crown. Used in coffee and cacao plantations in some regions, though this practice is discouraged.

**Traditional Medicine (Africa)**: In its native Africa, various parts are used medicinally:

- Bark infusions for skin diseases and wounds
- Leaf extracts for fever
- Flowers for ulcers and skin conditions

**Note**: These medicinal uses should NOT be attempted without expert guidance, as the plant contains toxic compounds.

**Wood**: The wood is soft, lightweight, and not durable. It has limited use for:

- Carving and utensils
- Nesting cavities for birds (naturally formed)
- Firewood (low quality, burns quickly)

The wood is not commercially valuable and trees are typically considered a nuisance rather than a resource.

### Recommendation for Costa Rica

**DO NOT PLANT**. If you are considering a flowering tree, choose native alternatives such as:

- **Poró** (_Erythrina poeppigiana_) - Native, nitrogen-fixing, stunning flowers
- **Cortez Amarillo** (_Tabebuia ochracea_) - Native, yellow flowers
- **Jícaro** (_Crescentia cujete_) - Native Bignoniaceae relative
- **Roble Sabana** (_Tabebuia rosea_) - Native, pink flowers

These native species provide similar ornamental value without the ecological harm.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

### In Native Africa

In tropical Africa, _Spathodea campanulata_ is an appreciated part of the forest landscape and has traditional significance in some cultures. The striking flowers appear in African art and the tree is associated with celebration and vitality.

### In Introduced Regions (Costa Rica)

The tree was introduced to Costa Rica in the early-mid 20th century as an ornamental, prized for its spectacular blooms. It became a popular street tree in urban areas, particularly in the Central Valley.

The Spanish name **"Llama del Bosque"** (Flame of the Forest) reflects its brilliant orange-red flowers that light up the landscape like flames.

However, awareness of its invasive impacts has grown since the 1990s, and the tree is now viewed with increasing concern. It represents the problematic legacy of introducing exotic species without understanding their ecological impacts.

### Children's Tree

In many tropical countries, children enjoy squeezing the water-filled flower buds to make them squirt - giving rise to names like "Pichkari" (water pistol) in India. While this is a nostalgic memory for many, it's important to educate children about the tree's problems and discourage interaction with it.

## Conservation Status & Invasive Species Information

<Callout type="warning" title="Invasive Species - Do Not Plant">
  While listed as **Least Concern** in its native African range, _Spathodea
  campanulata_ is recognized as one of the **"World's Worst Invasive Alien
  Species"** by the IUCN Invasive Species Specialist Group. It is invasive
  throughout tropical regions worldwide, including Costa Rica.
</Callout>

### Native Range Status

In its native tropical Africa, the species is common and faces no conservation threats. Populations are stable and the tree is not at risk of extinction.

### Invasive Status (Costa Rica and Global)

**Classification**: One of the world's 100 worst invasive species (IUCN)

**Impact Level**: HIGH - Serious threat to native biodiversity

**Management Priority**: High - Should be controlled and prevented from spreading

### Ecological Impacts in Costa Rica

1. **Forest Disruption**: Seeds disperse into forest gaps and edges, establishing dense stands that prevent native tree regeneration
2. **Biodiversity Loss**: Reduces plant species diversity under its canopy through heavy shading and possibly allelopathy
3. **Pollinator Harm**: Nectar is toxic to some native bee species, affecting pollination networks
4. **Difficult Eradication**: Trees resprout from cut stumps and produce root suckers, making removal challenging
5. **Seed Bank Persistence**: Seeds can persist in soil, causing long-term invasion pressure

### Current Management Approach

In Costa Rica and other invaded regions:

- **Discouraged for Planting**: Not recommended for landscaping or reforestation
- **Removal Programs**: Some conservation areas actively remove the species
- **Public Education**: Efforts to raise awareness about its invasive nature
- **Native Alternatives Promoted**: Encouraging planting of native flowering trees

### What You Can Do

If you have an African tulip tree on your property:

1. **Consider Removal**: Especially if near forests or protected areas
2. **Prevent Spread**: Remove seedlings promptly
3. **Do Not Allow Seeds to Escape**: Remove seed pods before they open
4. **Plant Natives Instead**: Replace with native Costa Rican species
5. **Report Infestations**: Contact local environmental authorities about large infestations

**Never Plant**: Do not plant new African tulip trees under any circumstances.

## Growing African Tulip Tree (NOT RECOMMENDED)

<Callout type="error" title="Do Not Plant This Species">
  **IMPORTANT**: This section is provided for identification and management
  purposes only. African tulip tree should **NOT** be planted in Costa Rica or
  anywhere outside its native African range. Plant native species instead.
</Callout>

### Why This Tree Should Not Be Cultivated

1. **Invasive Species**: Spreads aggressively, harming native ecosystems
2. **Poisonous**: Seeds and fruit are toxic to humans and pets
3. **Harms Native Bees**: Nectar is toxic to some pollinator species
4. **Difficult to Control**: Produces root suckers and abundant seeds
5. **Large Size**: Requires extensive space and can cause property damage

### If You Already Have One

**Management Recommendations**:

1. **Monitor Closely**: Check regularly for seedlings spreading from your tree
2. **Remove Seedlings**: Pull or dig up any seedlings immediately
3. **Collect Seed Pods**: Remove and dispose of seed pods before they open (bag and trash, do not compost)
4. **Control Root Suckers**: Cut and herbicide root suckers as they appear
5. **Consider Professional Removal**: Especially if tree is near natural areas
6. **Do Not Prune to Encourage Flowering**: More flowers = more seeds = more spread

### Removal Methods

**Small Trees (< 5 m)**:

- Manual removal with root excavation
- Cut stump and apply herbicide to prevent resprouting

**Large Trees (> 5 m)**:

- Requires professional tree removal service
- Cut and herbicide treatment of stump
- Monitor and remove root suckers for 2-3 years after removal
- Consider girdling as alternative to removal in sensitive areas

**Always**: Dispose of wood, seeds, and roots properly - do not compost as seeds may remain viable.
