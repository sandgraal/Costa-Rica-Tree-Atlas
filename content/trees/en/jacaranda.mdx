# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "low"
toxicParts:
  - "seeds"
  - "pods"
skinContactRisk: "none"
allergenRisk: "low"
structuralRisks: []
childSafe: true
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "Jacaranda has low toxicity. The seeds and pods are mildly toxic if ingested in quantity - contain compounds that can cause stomach upset, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. However, the seeds are not palatable and rarely consumed. The flowers and leaves are essentially non-toxic. There are scattered reports of mild toxicity from seed ingestion but no severe poisonings documented. The tree is widely planted in urban areas globally without significant safety concerns."
skinContactDetails: "No skin irritation. Safe to handle flowers, leaves, and branches. The wood can cause minor sawdust irritation during woodworking (wear dust mask)."
allergenDetails: "LOW allergen risk. Pollen production is minimal. Some individuals may have mild respiratory sensitivity to fallen flowers or pollen. Wood dust may cause respiratory irritation in woodworkers."
safetyNotes: "Extremely safe ornamental tree suitable for urban planting, parks, and home gardens. The dramatic purple flower display is the tree's main feature. Fallen flowers create a beautiful purple carpet but can be slippery when wet. Children play around these trees safely worldwide. The seed pods are large and woody but not typically opened by children. This is one of the most popular ornamental trees globally with an excellent safety record."
wildlifeRisks: "Safe for pets including dogs and cats. While listed as mildly toxic to pets by some sources, actual poisonings are rare. Pets may eat fallen flowers without issue. Wildlife including birds and bees visit the flowers safely. Nectar is valuable for pollinators."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "moderate"
growthRateDetails: "2-3 ft/year; begins flowering in 5-8 years from seed, 2-3 years from grafted/nursery trees"
matureSize: "10-20 m tall (typically 12-15 m in cultivation), crown spread 8-12 m"
hardiness: "Subtropical highlands; optimal 800-1800m elevation; prefers cooler Central Valley climate"
soilRequirements: "Adaptable; prefers well-drained sandy loam; pH 6-7.5; tolerates poor soils but grows better in fertile conditions; does NOT tolerate waterlogging"
waterNeeds: "moderate"
waterDetails: "Moderate water needs during establishment. Young trees need regular watering for first 2-3 years. Mature trees are moderately drought-tolerant once established. Tree is DECIDUOUS - loses leaves in dry season, creating spectacular synchronized flowering on bare branches. Best flowering occurs with distinct dry season stress. Avoid excessive watering during dry season or flowering diminishes."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plant 8-12 m apart; 8 m minimum from buildings, roads, and power lines; needs space for wide crown"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
  - "grafting"
  - "cuttings"
propagationDifficulty: "moderate"
plantingSeason: "Plant container trees year-round; best at start of rainy season (May-June) for field planting"
maintenanceNeeds: "LOW to MODERATE maintenance for urban ornamental. Years 1-3: Water regularly, stake if needed for wind, prune to develop single strong trunk and well-spaced scaffold branches. Fertilize lightly 2-3 times annually with balanced fertilizer. Years 4-10: Minimal care, prune lightly after flowering to shape and remove crossing branches, fertilize annually if growth slow. Mature trees: Very low maintenance once established. Optional annual pruning to control size and shape crown after flowering (April-May). Remove dead wood as needed. ADVANTAGE: Tree self-cleans - most spent flowers fall naturally. Stunning seasonal display with minimal inputs. CAUTION: Fallen flowers can be slippery on walkways when wet - hose or sweep regularly during peak bloom. Leaf drop in dry season creates temporary mess but signals coming flower show."
commonProblems:
  - "Poor flowering - caused by excessive water/fertilizer during dry season; tree needs dry season stress to flower heavily"
  - "Slippery fallen flowers on pavement - natural, clean walkways regularly during bloom"
  - "Branch breakage in wind - prune to develop strong structure when young"
  - "Chlorosis (yellow leaves) in alkaline soils - apply iron sulfate or soil acidifier"
  - "Volunteer seedlings from dropped seed pods - easy to remove, or leave for free trees"
  - "Slow establishment in heavy clay - plant on mound, improve drainage with organic matter"

## Physical Description

### General Form

Jacaranda is a medium-sized deciduous tree with an open, spreading crown that becomes rounded with age. The tree is deciduous, dropping its feathery foliage before flowering, which showcases the blooms spectacularly against the bare branches. The delicate, lacy appearance of its bipinnate leaves adds year-round elegance.

<Callout type="tip" title="Timing the Bloom">
  In Costa Rica, Jacarandas typically bloom at the **end of dry season** (late
  March through May), just before the first rains arrive. The trees are often
  leafless during flowering, making the purple display even more dramatic. A
  light rain after peak bloom creates a magical scene as petals carpet the
  ground. Mark your calendar—Jacaranda season is one of Costa Rica's most
  beautiful natural events!

## Flowering Phenomenon

### The Purple Spectacle

<FeatureBox title="Why Jacaranda Blooms Are So Special" icon="💜">
  Several factors combine to make Jacaranda flowering extraordinary: - **Mass
  Flowering**: Entire canopy blooms simultaneously - **Leafless Display**:
  Flowers appear before leaves, maximizing visibility - **Color Rarity**:
  Blue-purple is unusual in flowering trees - **Duration**: Weeks of continuous
  bloom - **Fallen Flowers**: Create purple carpets on ground - **Timing**: End
  of dry season = perfect photo weather Cities like Pretoria (South Africa) and
  Grafton (Australia) are famous for their Jacaranda-lined streets. Costa Rica's
  Central Valley has its own spectacular displays.
</FeatureBox>

### Flowering Requirements

<Callout type="warning" title="Getting Jacarandas to Bloom">
  Jacarandas need specific conditions for their best flowering: - **Dry
  Period**: A distinct dry season triggers flowering - **Full Sun**: Shade
  reduces bloom intensity - **Age**: Trees typically begin flowering at 5-7
  years - **Cool Period**: Some cool weather helps trigger buds - **Avoid
  Over-Watering**: Too much water = fewer flowers In Costa Rica's humid
  lowlands, Jacarandas often grow well but flower poorly. The Central Valley's
  climate is ideal.

## Ecological Value

### Wildlife Interactions

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Pollinators

- **Bees**: Major pollinators; important nectar source
- **Butterflies**: Visit flowers frequently
- **Hummingbirds**: Occasional visitors
- **Native Pollinators**: Support local species

</Column>
<Column>

#### Other Wildlife

- **Nesting**: Open structure used by some birds

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

### Ecosystem Considerations

<Callout type="info" title="Exotic but Beloved">
  While not native to Costa Rica, Jacaranda is generally considered benign: -
  **Not Invasive**: Doesn't spread aggressively in Costa Rica - **Pollinator
  Support**: Valuable nectar for bees - **Urban Wildlife**: Provides food and
  shelter in cities - **Climate Fit**: Grows well in appropriate zones However,
  planting native species should be prioritized for ecosystem restoration and
  biodiversity conservation.

## Cultural Significance

### Global Icon

<FeatureBox title="A Tree of Celebration" icon="🎊">
  Jacaranda has become culturally significant across the world: - **South
  Africa**: Pretoria is called "Jacaranda City"; blooms mark exam season -
  **Australia**: Grafton has an annual Jacaranda Festival - **Mexico**: Featured
  in art, literature, and gardens - **Los Angeles**: Lines many streets; beloved
  urban tree - **Argentina**: National symbol; "Jacarandá" is a popular name The

<Callout type="success" title="Purple Dreams">
  Few trees capture human imagination quite like the Jacaranda in full bloom.
  That ethereal blue-purple haze, the way fallen petals create rivers of color
  on sidewalks, the contrast of purple against a blue sky—it's nature at its
  most theatrical. While not native to Costa Rica, the Jacaranda has earned its
  place in the country's urban landscapes, bringing joy and wonder to millions
  every dry season. When you see a Jacaranda in bloom, take a moment to stand
  beneath it, look up through the purple canopy, and appreciate one of the
  world's most beautiful trees doing what it does best—being utterly,
  extravagantly gorgeous.
