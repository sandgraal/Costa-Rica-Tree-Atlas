# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "none"
toxicParts: []
skinContactRisk: "none"
allergenRisk: "low"
structuralRisks: ["falling-branches"]
childSafe: true
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "Cortez Blanco is non-toxic. No parts of the tree—leaves, flowers, bark, or seeds—are harmful if ingested. The tree is safe for planting in areas frequented by children and pets. Some Bignoniaceae family members contain lapachol compounds, but Roseodendron donnell-smithii does not present toxicity concerns at levels encountered in normal contact."
skinContactDetails: "No skin irritation risk from contact with leaves, bark, flowers, or sap. The tree is completely safe to touch and handle. No reports of contact dermatitis associated with the living tree."
allergenDetails: "Low allergen risk. Pollen from the abundant trumpet-shaped flowers may cause mild reactions in individuals with severe pollen sensitivities during peak flowering (February-April). The flowers are primarily insect-pollinated, reducing airborne pollen dispersal. Overall allergen risk is minimal for the general population."
structuralRiskDetails: "Large mature trees may drop heavy branches during strong winds or storms, typical of large deciduous trees. Dead branch shedding can occur during the dry season. Regular arboricultural inspection and pruning of dead wood recommended for trees planted near structures or pedestrian areas."
safetyNotes: "Cortez Blanco is an excellent and safe tree for urban landscapes, parks, school grounds, and residential areas. No poisoning risk to children, pets, or wildlife. The only consideration is potential branch drop from large mature specimens during extreme weather, standard for any large shade tree. Fallen flowers can create slippery surfaces on paved areas when wet."
wildlifeRisks: "Completely safe for wildlife. Flowers provide important nectar resources for bees, hummingbirds, and butterflies during the dry season when other food sources are scarce. Seeds are not toxic to any animals."

## Overview

_Roseodendron donnell-smithii_ (formerly classified as _Tabebuia donnell-smithii_), commonly known as Cortez Blanco or Primavera, is one of the most visually striking trees in the Neotropics. During the dry season, typically between February and April, this deciduous tree sheds its leaves entirely and erupts into an unforgettable mass of bright golden-yellow trumpet-shaped flowers that can be seen from great distances.

The tree is closely related to the other _Tabebuia_ species found in Costa Rica, such as Corteza Amarilla (_Tabebuia ochracea_) and Cortez Negro (_Tabebuia impetiginosa_), but is distinguished by its larger overall size, lighter-colored bark, and exceptionally abundant flower production. The species was reclassified from _Tabebuia_ to _Roseodendron_ based on molecular phylogenetic studies that revealed it belongs to a distinct lineage within the Bignoniaceae family.

In Costa Rica, Cortez Blanco grows naturally in the Pacific lowlands and mid-elevation zones, particularly in Guanacaste and the Central Valley transition zones. It is one of the most widely planted ornamental trees in Central American cities, lining boulevards and gracing parks with its seasonal spectacle. The timber, known commercially as "Primavera," is highly valued for furniture making and interior finishing, sometimes called the "mahogany of the Bignoniaceae."

Unfortunately, over-harvesting for its prized wood has led to a **Vulnerable (VU)** conservation status, making reforestation and cultivation efforts increasingly important for the species' survival.

### Taxonomic Notes

The species was originally described as _Cybistax donnell-smithii_ by John Donnell Smith in 1899, then reclassified to _Tabebuia donnell-smithii_. Modern molecular phylogenetic studies (Grose and Olmstead, 2007) demonstrated that the traditional genus _Tabebuia_ was polyphyletic, leading to its reclassification into the monotypic genus _Roseodendron_. The specific epithet _donnell-smithii_ honors the American botanist John Donnell Smith (1829–1928), who made significant contributions to Central American botany.

## Physical Description

### Tree Form

Cortez Blanco is a large deciduous tree reaching 25–40 meters in height with a trunk diameter of 50–100 cm. The trunk is typically straight and cylindrical, often clear of branches for the lower 10–15 meters in forest settings. The crown is broad, spreading, and somewhat irregular, providing excellent shade when in full leaf. During the dry season, the tree becomes completely leafless before flowering, making the golden flower display even more dramatic.

### Bark

The bark is light gray to whitish, smooth on young trees and becoming moderately fissured and slightly roughened with age. The pale bark color contributes to the common name "Cortez Blanco" (White Cortez), distinguishing it from the darker-barked Cortez Negro. Inner bark is pale yellowish.

### Leaves

Leaves are palmately compound with 5–7 leaflets arranged digitately at the end of a long petiole (15–30 cm). Individual leaflets are elliptic to obovate, 8–20 cm long and 4–8 cm wide, with entire margins and acuminate tips. The upper surface is dark green and slightly glossy; the lower surface is paler with fine pubescence along the veins. Leaves emerge after flowering, typically in May with the onset of rains.

### Flowers

The flowers are the tree's most spectacular feature. They are large, trumpet-shaped (campanulate), 5–8 cm long and 4–6 cm wide, with a bright golden-yellow color. The corolla has five fused petals forming a broad tube that flares into ruffled lobes. The throat displays fine reddish-orange nectar guides that direct pollinators. Flowers are produced in dense terminal panicles of 20–50+ blooms, appearing on bare branches during February–April. The flowering is synchronous across the crown, creating a solid mass of yellow that is visible for kilometers.

### Fruit and Seeds

The fruit is a linear capsule, 15–35 cm long and 1.5–2 cm wide, pendant from the branch tips. Capsules are smooth, greenish when young, drying to brown and splitting longitudinally to release numerous winged seeds. Each seed is thin, membranous, and equipped with transparent wings 1–2 cm wide that aid wind dispersal. Seeds are produced in abundance but lose viability rapidly, requiring prompt collection and sowing.

In Costa Rica, Cortez Blanco is found primarily along the Pacific slope, from the dry forests of Guanacaste through the transition zones of the Central Valley to the moist Pacific lowlands of Puntarenas. It grows naturally in deciduous and semi-deciduous forests, often appearing along riversides and in fertile valley bottoms where deep soils provide optimal growing conditions.

The tree is particularly prominent in the Tempisque River basin in Guanacaste, where it forms part of the dry forest canopy alongside Guanacaste (_Enterolobium cyclocarpum_), Pochote (_Pachira quinata_), and other deciduous species. It also occurs in the transitional forests of the Nicoya Peninsula and the Dota-Pérez Zeledón corridor.

### Broader Distribution

Beyond Costa Rica, the species ranges from southern Mexico (Guerrero, Oaxaca, Chiapas) through Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and into northern Panama. It has been widely planted as an ornamental throughout the tropics, including South America, the Caribbean, and tropical Asia.

### Ecological Role

Cortez Blanco plays a significant ecological role, particularly during the dry season when few other trees are flowering. Its massive, synchronous flower production provides a critical nectar and pollen resource for bees, hummingbirds, butterflies, and other pollinators at a time when food sources are scarce. The flowers are especially important for native stingless bees (_Meliponini_) and large carpenter bees (_Xylocopa_) that are among the primary pollinators.

### Wildlife Associations

- **Pollinators**: Large bees (Xylocopa, Centris, Eulaema), hummingbirds, butterflies
- **Seed dispersers**: Wind (anemochory) — winged seeds travel considerable distances
- **Nesting habitat**: Cavities in older trees used by parrots, toucans, and small mammals
- **Epiphytes**: Large branches support orchids, bromeliads, and ferns in moist areas
- **Insect associations**: Host to various caterpillar species (Sphingidae, Saturniidae)

### Ecological Adaptations

The deciduous habit is a key drought adaptation. By shedding all leaves during the driest months, the tree minimizes water loss while channeling stored resources into spectacular flower production. This "big bang" reproductive strategy maximizes pollinator attraction and cross-pollination success. The timing of flower and fruit production before the rainy season ensures that the wind-dispersed seeds have optimal conditions for germination when the rains arrive.

### Timber

The wood of Cortez Blanco, marketed internationally as **Primavera**, is one of the most valued light-colored hardwoods in the tropics. The heartwood ranges from pale yellowish to golden brown with an attractive grain pattern that sometimes displays ribbon-figure when quartersawn. It is moderately hard, works easily with hand and machine tools, takes finishes beautifully, and has excellent dimensional stability. The wood has been compared to mahogany in working properties and is used for:

- Fine furniture and cabinetwork
- Architectural paneling and molding
- Musical instrument components
- Decorative veneers
- Boat interiors
- High-quality plywood

### Ornamental Value

Perhaps no other Central American tree produces a more spectacular urban display than Cortez Blanco in full flower. Rows of these trees lining boulevards and parks create corridors of brilliant gold in February and March. The tree is extensively planted in Central American and Mexican cities for this purpose. In Costa Rica, it is increasingly used in urban forestry programs in the Central Valley and Pacific lowland cities.

### Honey Production

The abundant flowers produce copious nectar, making Cortez Blanco one of the most important honey trees in the dry Pacific region. Beekeepers in Guanacaste and the Nicoya Peninsula consider the Cortez flowering season a major honey flow. The resulting honey has a light color and delicate flavor.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

Cortez Blanco holds deep cultural significance across Central America. In Guatemala and Mexico, the flowering of Primavera trees is celebrated as a harbinger of the rainy season and associated with renewal and hope. The Spanish common name "Primavera" literally means "spring," reflecting the tree's association with the transition from dry to wet season.

In Costa Rica, the annual flowering of Cortez trees (both Blanco and Amarillo) along roads and in fields is one of the most beloved natural spectacles. The brilliant yellow canopies against the parched, brown landscape of Guanacaste in February and March are among the most photographed natural scenes in the country, frequently featured in tourism promotion materials.

### Indigenous Uses

Pre-Columbian peoples of Mesoamerica used the wood for construction and tool-making. The Chorotega people of Guanacaste incorporated the tree into their landscape management practices. The bark has been used in traditional medicine as an astringent and for treating skin conditions.

### Economic Importance

The timber trade of Primavera has been historically significant, particularly in Mexico and Guatemala where the finest specimens were exported. Over-exploitation throughout the 20th century severely depleted natural populations, leading to the current Vulnerable conservation status and restrictions on international trade.

---

## Conservation Status

<Callout type="warning" title="Vulnerable Species">
  Cortez Blanco is classified as **Vulnerable (VU)** by the IUCN due to
  over-exploitation for its valuable timber and habitat loss from deforestation.

## Growing Cortez Blanco

### Site Selection

Choose a location with full sun exposure and deep, well-drained soil. Cortez Blanco performs best in areas with a distinct dry season (3–5 months) which triggers the spectacular flowering. Avoid waterlogged sites or heavy clay soils. The tree needs ample space for its large crown — plan for a mature spread of 12–18 meters.

### Propagation

Seeds are the primary method of propagation. Collect capsules when they begin to turn brown and split (typically April–May). Extract winged seeds and sow immediately, as viability declines rapidly. Direct sow in nursery beds or individual containers at 1–2 cm depth. Germination occurs in 10–20 days with fresh seed. Seedlings grow quickly and can be transplanted at 30–50 cm height after 3–4 months.

### Planting

Transplant seedlings at the beginning of the rainy season (May–June) for best establishment. Dig planting holes 50 × 50 × 50 cm and amend with compost if soil is poor. Water thoroughly after planting and provide weekly supplemental irrigation through the first dry season. Staking may be necessary in windy sites.

### Pest and Disease Management

Cortez Blanco is generally pest-resistant. Occasional issues include:

- **Leaf miners**: Can create unsightly trails in leaves but rarely threaten tree health
- **Cerambycid beetles**: May bore into weakened or damaged wood; maintain tree vigor through proper care
- **Fungal leaf spots**: Occur in overly humid conditions; ensure good air circulation
- **Scale insects**: May appear on young growth; treat with horticultural oil if severe
