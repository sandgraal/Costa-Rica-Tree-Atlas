childSafe: true
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "Low toxicity. Ripe fruit flesh is completely safe and delicious to eat. However, SEEDS contain saponins and should not be eaten—they can cause digestive upset if chewed and swallowed. Unripe fruit contains more tannins and latex, making it unpalatable and potentially causing mouth irritation. Always wait until fruit is fully ripe and soft. The chicle latex is non-toxic and was traditionally chewed as natural chewing gum."
skinContactDetails: "Tree produces milky latex (chicle) when bark is cut. Generally non-irritating—it was harvested extensively for chewing gum. Some sensitive individuals may experience mild skin irritation from latex. Ripe fruit flesh causes no issues."
allergenDetails: "Very low allergen risk. Not known to cause significant allergic reactions. Latex rarely causes problems."
safetyNotes: "Safe tree for residential and public areas. Fruit is a traditional food when ripe. Teach children to eat only ripe fruit (soft, brown) and to spit out seeds. Unripe fruit is hard, astringent, and not palatable. Excellent choice for edible landscaping. This is the tree that gave us natural chewing gum (chicle). Overall very safe."
wildlifeRisks: "Safe for wildlife and pets. Fruits are eaten by birds, bats, and mammals. Seeds may cause mild digestive upset if pets eat them in quantity, but rarely a serious problem."

# Níspero (Sapodilla - The Chewing Gum Tree)

<Callout type="success" title="The Tree That Changed Your Bubble">
  The **Níspero** or **Sapodilla** (_Manilkara zapota_) is one of the most
  historically significant trees of the Americas—the source of **chicle**, the
  original chewing gum. For over a century, the milky latex from this tree's
  bark was the base for all chewing gum worldwide. But beyond its industrial
  fame, this beautiful tree produces one of the most delicious tropical fruits:
  a brown, grainy-textured sphere with flesh like brown sugar and caramel. From
  ancient Maya civilization to modern orchards, the Níspero continues to sweeten
  human life in multiple ways.

## Physical Description

### Overall Form

The Níspero is a handsome evergreen tree with dense, dark green foliage and a rounded crown. Its bark is deeply fissured and oozes white latex when cut. The tree grows slowly but lives for centuries, with ancient specimens found in Maya archaeological sites. The wood is remarkably hard and durable, making it prized for construction.

## The Chicle Story

### History of Chewing Gum

<FeatureBox title="From Maya to Wrigley's" icon="🫧">
  The history of chicle is a fascinating tale of ancient tradition meeting
  modern industry: **Ancient Origins**: - Maya and Aztec peoples chewed chicle
  for thousands of years - Used to clean teeth and freshen breath - Associated
  with rituals and medicine **The Industrial Age** (1860s-1940s): - Mexican
  General Santa Anna introduced chicle to New York - Thomas Adams created first
  commercial chicle gum (1871) - William Wrigley made it a global phenomenon -
  Chicle became Mexico and Guatemala's main forest export **The Chiclero
  Culture**: - Specialized workers called "chicleros" tapped trees - Lived in
  jungle camps during rainy season - Dangerous, skilled work - Vital to rural
  economies **The Decline** (1950s onward): - Synthetic alternatives replaced
  chicle - Most modern gum is petroleum-based - Some artisanal brands reviving
  natural chicle
</FeatureBox>

### Chicle Extraction

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Traditional Tapping Method">
    **The Process**: 1. **Season**: Rainy season (latex flows better) 2.
    **Selection**: Trees over 30 years old preferred 3. **Climbing**: Chiclero
    climbs using rope/spikes 4. **Cutting**: Zigzag cuts in bark (about 1m
    apart) 5. **Collection**: Latex flows down into bag at base 6. **Boiling**:
    Raw latex boiled to concentrate 7. **Molding**: Formed into blocks for
    export **Yield**: 3-5 kg per tree per season **Rest**: Trees need 3-4 years
    between tappings
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Modern Natural Chicle">
    **Revival Interest**: - Growing demand for natural, sustainable products -
    Mexican brands like "Chicza" producing organic chicle gum - Forest
    communities benefit from sustainable harvest - Biodegradable (unlike
    petroleum gum) **Conservation Link**: Natural chicle extraction: - Keeps
    standing forest valuable - Provides income without deforestation - Maintains
    traditional knowledge

## Identification Guide

### How to Identify Níspero

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Key Identification Features" defaultOpen={true}>
    **Year-Round Identifiers:**

    1. **Dense, dark green foliage** clustered at branch tips
    2. **Deeply fissured bark** with white latex
    3. **Leathery elliptical leaves**
    4. **Fruit scars on branches** (where old fruit attached)
    5. **Slow-growing, long-lived** appearance

    **Diagnostic Test:**
    - Cut bark → white sticky latex = Níspero (Be careful not to damage tree unnecessarily)

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Similar Species">
    <DataTable
      headers={["Species", "Key Difference"]}
      rows={[
        ["_Pouteria sapota_ (Mamey)", "Larger leaves, larger fruit"],

<Callout type="success" title="From Sacred Tree to Global Industry">
  The Níspero embodies the intersection of human culture and nature in the
  American tropics. Sacred to the ancient Maya, who cultivated it for millennia,
  this tree later became the source of a global industry when chicle met
  American entrepreneurship. Though synthetic polymers have largely replaced
  natural chicle, the tree remains beloved for its incomparable fruit—that
  brown, grainy sweetness that tastes like brown sugar made by nature. Every
  bite of a perfectly ripe sapodilla connects you to thousands of years of human
  cultivation, from ancient Maya temples to modern Indian orchards. In a world
  of synthetic everything, the Níspero reminds us that some natural pleasures
  simply cannot be replicated.
