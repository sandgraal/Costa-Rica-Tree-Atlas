# Arazá (Araçá-boi)

<Callout type="success" title="Amazonian Superfruit in Costa Rica">
  The **Arazá** (_Eugenia stipitata_), also known as Araçá-boi or Membrillo, is
  a remarkable Amazonian fruit tree that has found a home in Costa Rica's
  tropical lowlands. Famous for its intensely aromatic fruits that contain
  **twice the vitamin C of oranges**, the arazá transforms into delicious
  juices, ice creams, and desserts when blended with sugar. This lesser-known
  superfruit represents an exciting addition to Costa Rica's diverse tropical
  fruit cultivation.

<FeatureBox title="Arazá Juice Recipe" icon="🥤">
  **Amazonian Refreshment**

**Ingredients**:

- 2-3 ripe arazá fruits (about 500g)
- 1 liter cold water
- Sugar to taste (generous amount needed due to acidity)
- Ice

**Preparation**:

1. Select fruits that are slightly soft and intensely fragrant
2. Wash and cut fruits, removing any damaged portions
3. Scoop flesh and blend thoroughly with water
4. Strain to remove seeds and fibers
5. Add sugar gradually, tasting until acidity is balanced
6. Serve very cold over ice

**Tips**:

- The pH of arazá juice is around 2.4—very acidic!
- Start with more sugar than you think you need
- The intense aroma is normal and desirable

## Cultivation

### Growing Arazá

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Site Requirements">
    **Ideal Conditions**:
    - Lowland tropical climate (0-650m elevation)
    - Hot, humid environment
    - Well-drained acidic soils
    - Partial shade acceptable (even beneficial)
    - Protection from strong winds

    **Soil Preferences**:
    - Tolerates poor, highly leached soils
    - Prefers acidic pH
    - Good drainage essential
    - Organic matter beneficial but not required

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Propagation">
    **From Seed** (primary method):
    - Extract seeds from fully mature fruits
    - Plant within 5 days (recalcitrant seeds)
    - Keep seed beds completely shaded
    - Use partly decomposed softwood as medium
    - Plant 2 cm apart, lightly covered
    - Germination takes up to 80 days
    - 80% germination rate if kept in water up to 60 days

    **Important**: Seeds lose over 70% viability after 40 days in cold storage—fresh planting is essential!

    **Transplanting**:
    - Move seedlings at 7-10 cm height
    - Use 6-8 kg polyethylene bags
    - Mix earth with 10% manure
    - Keep 6 months in shade, 6 months in partial shade

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Planting and Care">
    **Field Planting**:
    - Plant after one year in nursery
    - Spacing: 3 x 3 m recommended
    - Hole size: 50 cm deep, 30-50 cm diameter
    - Add 0.5 kg manure per hole

    **Maintenance**:
    - Weed monthly in planted area
    - Add organic material to soil
    - Organic fertilizer preferred over chemical
    - Prune young trees for 3-4 main branches
    - Annual cleanup pruning

    **Important**: Chemical fertilizers show no influence on fruit formation—organic management is sufficient and recommended.

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Harvest">
    **Timing**:
    - Fruits mature about 84 days after fruit set
    - Year-round production with 2-4 harvests annually
    - Harvest when color changes to yellow-green

    **Method**:
    - Harvest slightly green to avoid bruising
    - Post-harvest shelf life is only 72 hours if tree-ripened
    - Transport in plastic trays, maximum 3 fruit layers
    - Handle carefully—fruit is delicate

  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

## Conservation Status

<Callout type="info" title="Conservation Notes">
  **Status**: Least Concern (LC)

While not globally threatened, arazá remains an underutilized crop with significant potential. Conservation priorities include:

- **Genetic diversity**: Preserving cultivated varieties
- **In-situ conservation**: Protecting wild populations in Amazon
- **Ex-situ collections**: Maintaining germplasm in research centers
- **Seed challenges**: Recalcitrant seeds cannot be stored conventionally
