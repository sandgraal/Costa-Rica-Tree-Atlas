### Taxonomic Notes

The species was described by Swedish botanist Olof Swartz in 1788. The genus _Brosimum_ contains approximately 15 species distributed throughout tropical America, several of which produce edible latex or fruits. _Brosimum lactescens_ is closely related to _B. utile_ (Mastate) and _B. alicastrum_ (Breadnut/Ramón), forming a complex of useful food-producing trees.

The genus is distinguished within the Moraceae by its peculiar inflorescence structure (globose heads) and the production of abundant white latex in many species. _Brosimum lactescens_ is specifically characterized by its montane distribution and the quality of its edible latex.

The Moraceae family includes figs (_Ficus_), breadfruit (_Artocarpus_), and mulberry (_Morus_), many of which produce edible fruits or latex. _Brosimum_ species are among the most important latex-producing trees for human consumption in tropical America.

### Etymology

- **Brosimum**: From Greek _brosimos_ meaning "edible" or "good to eat," referring to the edible latex and fruits produced by many species in this genus
- **lactescens**: From Latin _lactescens_ meaning "becoming milky" or "producing milk," directly referencing the copious white latex that flows from wounds in the bark

## Physical/Botanical Description

### Tree Form

Lechoso Montañero is a medium to large evergreen tree typically reaching 20-30 meters in height, occasionally taller in optimal conditions. The trunk is straight and cylindrical, typically 40-80 cm in diameter at breast height, with low buttresses or none at all. The crown is rounded to spreading, moderately dense, and positioned in the canopy layer of montane forests.

The tree maintains its foliage year-round (evergreen) and is immediately recognizable when cut or wounded by the profuse white latex that exudes from any injury to the bark, branches, or leaves.

### Bark

The bark is gray to gray-brown, relatively smooth on young trees, becoming slightly roughened with shallow vertical fissures with age. The outer bark is thin to medium thickness. The most distinctive feature is the abundant white latex that flows freely when the bark is cut or wounded—far more copious than in most latex-producing trees.

The latex is thick, milk-white, and has a sweet, slightly nutty flavor. Unlike the toxic latex of many tropical trees, this latex is completely edible and nutritious. Fresh cuts can produce substantial quantities—up to several liters from a large tree if properly tapped.

### Leaves

  />
  <PropertyCard
    icon="🌿"
    label="Type"
    value="Simple, oblong-elliptic to oblong-lanceolate"
  />
</PropertiesGrid>

The leaves are simple and arranged alternately in a spiral pattern along the branches. Individual leaves are 8-18 cm long and 3-7 cm wide, oblong-elliptic to oblong-lanceolate in shape. The leaf base is acute to rounded, while the apex is acuminate (tapering to a pointed tip) to acute.

The upper leaf surface is dark green, smooth, and glossy, while the lower surface is paler green and matte. The texture is slightly coriaceous (leathery) but not thick. Lateral veins are 8-15 pairs, ascending at an angle of 45-60 degrees from the prominent midrib. When crushed or torn, leaves exude white latex from the veins.

Leaves are attached by stout petioles 0.5-1.5 cm long. Stipules are present but quickly deciduous (falling early), leaving small scars on the twigs.

### Flowers

  />
  <PropertyCard
    icon="📅"
    label="Season"
    value="March-May, sometimes sporadic"
  />
</PropertiesGrid>

The flowers are tiny and arranged in distinctive globose (spherical) heads characteristic of the genus _Brosimum_. These heads are 4-8 mm in diameter and contain numerous minute flowers densely packed together. The heads are greenish-yellow and inconspicuous, produced on short stalks from leaf axils.

Individual flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers in separate heads (monoecious condition—both sexes on the same tree). Male heads contain numerous stamens, while female heads contain pistils that will develop into fruits.

Flowering occurs primarily from March through May, coinciding with the dry-to-wet season transition in many areas. Trees may also flower sporadically at other times. The flowers are pollinated by small insects, particularly tiny flies and thrips attracted to the flower heads.

### Fruit & Seeds

The fruit is a syncarp (multiple fruit formed from the fusion of multiple flowers in the head), approximately 1.5-2.5 cm in diameter, spherical to slightly flattened. The surface is granular or warty, orange to orange-red when fully ripe, containing numerous tiny seeds embedded in a fleshy, sweet pulp.

Each fruit develops from an entire flower head, with the individual flowers fusing to form a compound structure similar to a fig (though structurally different). The pulp is edible and sweet, consumed by wildlife. Seeds are small, numerous, and dispersed primarily by bats, monkeys, and birds that eat the ripe fruits.

Fruiting occurs from June through September, following the flowering season. The orange-red fruits are visible against the green foliage and attract various frugivores (fruit-eating animals) that disperse the seeds throughout the forest.

### Ecological Role

Lechoso Montañero plays several important ecological roles in montane forest ecosystems:

1. **Wildlife Food Source**: The edible fruits provide important nutrition for frugivorous bats, monkeys, birds (especially toucans and trogons), and other forest mammals during the fruiting season
2. **Seed Dispersal**: Animals consuming fruits disperse seeds throughout the forest, facilitating forest regeneration and connectivity
3. **Canopy Structure**: Provides important canopy layer structure in premontane forests
4. **Latex Resource**: Various insects and some mammals consume or use the latex; certain insects have adapted to feed on latex without being trapped
5. **Host Plant**: Leaves and latex provide food for specialized insects including some butterfly larvae

### Forest Associations

Lechoso Montañero typically grows in association with diverse premontane and lower montane rainforest species:

**Common Associates:**

- _Nectandra_ species (Sigua, Aguacatillo) - Lauraceae family canopy trees
- _Quercus_ species (Robles/Oaks) - in upper elevation montane forests
- _Terminalia oblonga_ (Surá de Montaña) - montane emergent tree
- _Ocotea_ species - aromatic Lauraceae canopy trees
- _Symphonia globulifera_ (Cerillo) - wet forest species
- _Inga_ species (Guaba) - nitrogen-fixing legumes
- Various _Ficus_ species (Higueron) - fellow Moraceae members
- Dense epiphyte communities including orchids, bromeliads, and ferns

The tree is typically found in mature or mature-secondary forests rather than early successional growth, indicating a preference for established forest conditions.

### Climate & Soil Requirements

The species is adapted to humid montane conditions:

- **Temperature**: Prefers moderate tropical montane temperatures (18-26°C average); tolerates cooler conditions than lowland relatives; not frost-tolerant but handles cool nights
- **Rainfall**: Requires high rainfall (2500-4000+ mm annually) with no pronounced dry season; thrives in perhumid montane zones
- **Humidity**: High humidity essential year-round; typical of cloud-influenced montane forests
- **Soils**: Prefers deep, fertile, well-drained soils with high organic matter content; performs best on mountain forest soils derived from volcanic parent material; pH 5.5-7.0

The species is not tolerant of extended dry periods or seasonal drought, limiting its distribution to consistently humid forests.

### Phenology

- **Flowering**: March-May (primary season), sometimes sporadic year-round
- **Fruiting**: June-September, following flowering
- **Latex production**: Year-round, most abundant during rainy season
- **Leaf retention**: Evergreen, maintains full canopy year-round
- **Growth**: Moderate continuous growth during rainy season; slower during any drier periods

## Growing Lechoso Montañero

### Propagation

**From Seed:**

Seeds are the primary propagation method. They must be extracted from ripe (orange-red) fruits collected in June-September.

- **Collection**: Gather ripe fruits from trees or from forest floor if recently fallen; fruits should be soft and orange-red
- **Seed extraction**: Mash fruits and wash seeds to remove pulp; seeds are tiny and numerous
- **Viability**: Seeds lose viability relatively quickly; plant within 1-2 weeks of collection for best results
- **Storage**: If storage necessary, keep moist and cool (not dried); viability typically 1-2 months maximum
- **Sowing**: Sow seeds on surface of nursery beds or containers with fine potting mix; cover very lightly (1-2 mm) or press into soil surface
- **Germination**: Germination begins in 2-4 weeks; continues sporadically over 1-2 months; germination rates vary 40-70% with fresh seed
- **Seedling care**: Provide 50-70% shade initially; maintain consistent moisture; seedlings are initially small and grow slowly

**From Cuttings:**

Propagation from cuttings is possible but not commonly practiced:

- **Method**: Semi-hardwood cuttings 15-25 cm long, treated with rooting hormone
- **Conditions**: High humidity (mist system), warm temperatures, 70% shade
- **Success rate**: Variable, typically 30-50% with optimal conditions
- **Advantage**: Can preserve desirable traits (high latex production, good flavor)

### Nursery Management

**Seedling Care:**

- **Containers**: Use deep pots (20-30 cm) to accommodate taproot development
- **Soil mix**: Well-drained mix of forest soil, compost, and sand (3:2:1 ratio)
- **Watering**: Keep consistently moist but not waterlogged; water daily in dry weather
- **Light**: Begin with 50-70% shade; gradually increase light to 40-50% shade as seedlings grow
- **Fertilization**: Light application of balanced organic fertilizer (compost tea, dilute NPK 10-10-10) every 2-4 weeks
- **Pest control**: Monitor for leaf-cutting ants and caterpillars; generally few problems
- **Transplanting**: Seedlings ready to outplant when 30-60 cm tall (typically 8-12 months from sowing)
- **Hardening**: Expose to full sun gradually before outplanting

### Site Selection

Choose sites that match natural montane forest conditions:

- **Climate**: Humid premontane to lower montane zones with year-round rainfall
- **Elevation**: Optimal 300-1200 m; suitable 0-1600 m
- **Rainfall**: Areas receiving 2500+ mm annual rainfall with no prolonged dry season
- **Soil**: Deep, well-drained soils with good organic matter content
- **Light**: Full sun for faster growth; tolerates partial shade when young
- **Proximity**: Plant near water sources for ease of irrigation during establishment

**Not Suitable For:**

- Dry lowland areas (Guanacaste dry forest)
- Areas with pronounced dry season exceeding 2-3 months
- Very high elevations above 1600-1800 m (too cold)
- Poorly drained or compacted soils
- Areas with frequent strong winds

### Planting

1. **Timing**: Plant at beginning of rainy season (May-June) for best establishment
2. **Site Preparation**: Clear competing vegetation in 1-1.5 m radius around planting spot
3. **Hole Preparation**: Dig planting hole 40 x 40 x 40 cm, larger than root ball
4. **Planting Depth**: Plant at same depth as in nursery container
5. **Backfilling**: Fill hole with mixture of native soil and compost; firm gently
6. **Watering**: Water thoroughly after planting
7. **Mulching**: Apply 5-10 cm layer of organic mulch around base (not touching trunk) to retain moisture and suppress weeds
8. **Protection**: Consider protection from livestock or wildlife if necessary

### Spacing

Spacing depends on intended use:

- **Latex production (intensive)**: 8-10 m spacing (100-156 trees/hectare)—allows individual tree development and easy access for tapping
- **Mixed agroforestry**: 10-15 m spacing with other crops or trees interspersed
- **Timber and latex**: 10-12 m spacing for combined production
- **Forest restoration**: Variable spacing (8-15 m) mixed with diverse native species
- **Landscape planting**: 12-15 m from structures and other large trees

**Watering:**

- **Year 1-2**: Ensure consistent soil moisture; water regularly during any dry periods
- **Year 3+**: Once established, trees typically thrive on natural rainfall in suitable climate
- **Latex production**: Adequate moisture enhances latex flow; water stress reduces production

**Fertilizing:**

Not typically necessary in good forest soils:

- **Degraded sites**: Apply organic compost annually around base for first 3-5 years
- **Growth boost**: Optional application of balanced NPK (10-10-10) or organic fertilizer once or twice annually during rainy season
- **After establishment**: Fertilization generally unnecessary in forest soils

**Weeding:**

Critical in early years:

- **Year 1-2**: Maintain weed-free circle 1-1.5 m radius around young trees; weed every 1-2 months
- **Year 3-4**: Reduce to 2-3 times per year as tree grows
- **Year 5+**: Generally minimal weeding needed

**Pruning:**

Minimal pruning required:

- **Formative pruning**: Remove competing leaders if necessary to maintain single trunk
- **Lower branches**: Can be removed as tree grows if clear trunk is desired
- **Avoid excessive wounding**: Minimize cuts that cause latex loss
- **Timing**: Prune during drier periods if possible to reduce disease risk

**Latex Tapping (if desired):**

- **Tree size**: Wait until tree is at least 15-20 cm diameter at breast height (typically 8-12 years from planting)
- **Method**: Make shallow diagonal cuts in bark; latex flows into collection container
- **Rotation**: Rotate tapping locations around trunk to allow recovery
- **Frequency**: Allow 1-2 months between tapping same area
- **Season**: Rainy season typically produces most abundant latex flow

### Common Growing Problems

1. **Slow early establishment**:
   - **Solution**: Normal for the species; be patient; maintain optimal nursery conditions and weed control

2. **Insufficient moisture**:
   - **Solution**: Plant only in areas with adequate year-round rainfall; supplement water if necessary during establishment

3. **Competition from aggressive weeds**:
   - **Solution**: Maintain consistent weed control during first 2-3 years

4. **Not suitable for lowland dry areas**:
   - **Solution**: Recognize elevation and moisture requirements; don't attempt to grow in unsuitable areas

5. **Low germination rates**:
   - **Solution**: Collect abundant fresh seeds; plant immediately; provide optimal nursery conditions

### Growth Expectations

Lechoso Montañero has moderate growth rate:

- **Year 1**: 30-60 cm height; establishment phase, slow growth
- **Years 2-5**: 60-100 cm/year vertical growth; root system development
- **Years 5-10**: 80-120 cm/year; accelerated growth phase
- **Years 10-15**: Reaches 10-15 m height; begins flowering and fruiting
- **Years 15-20**: Continues growth to mature height; crown expansion
- **Mature size**: 20-30 years to reach mature height (20-30 m)
- **Latex production**: Begins significant latex production at 8-12 years; increases with tree size

Growth rates vary with site quality, rainfall, soil fertility, and management. Trees on optimal montane forest sites with consistent moisture grow faster than those on marginal sites.

## Similar Species

Lechoso Montañero can be confused with related _Brosimum_ species and other montane forest trees:

### Brosimum utile (Mastate)

**Relationship**: Closely related species, already documented in the Costa Rica Tree Atlas

**Key similarities**:

- Both produce copious edible white latex
- Similar leaf morphology
- Both in Moraceae family, same genus
- Similar uses and cultural importance

**Key differences**:

- _B. utile_ (Mastate) occurs at **lower elevations** (0-800 m) in true lowland rainforest
- _B. lactescens_ (Lechoso Montañero) prefers **higher elevations** (0-1600 m, optimal 300-1200 m) in premontane to lower montane forests
- _B. utile_ has **larger fruits** (3-4 cm diameter) compared to _B. lactescens_ (1.5-2.5 cm)
- _B. utile_ leaves are typically **larger** (10-25 cm) than _B. lactescens_ (8-18 cm)
- **Habitat**: Mastate in hot, humid lowlands; Lechoso Montañero in cooler mountain forests

**Identification tip**: Elevation is the best field character—if you're above 800 m in premontane forest, it's likely _B. lactescens_; if you're in hot lowland rainforest below 600 m, it's likely _B. utile_.

### Brosimum alicastrum (Ramón, Breadnut, Ojoche)

**Key similarities**: Same genus, Moraceae family

**Key differences**:

- _B. alicastrum_ is grown primarily for its **edible seeds** (roasted and eaten like chestnuts), not latex
- _B. alicastrum_ has a more seasonal deciduous character
- Seeds of Ramón were a major food staple in Mayan civilization
- Different fruit structure—larger, 2-3 cm diameter fruits with large seeds
- Often found in drier seasonal forests in addition to wet forests

### Other Moraceae (Fig Family) Trees

Several other Moraceae in Costa Rican forests produce latex:

- **_Ficus_ species (Higuerones)**: Produce white latex but it's not edible; distinctive strangling growth habit in many species; different fruit structure (syconium/figs)
- **_Castilla elastica_ (Hule, Rubber Tree)**: Produces latex that was historically used for rubber; latex is not edible; larger leaves (20-35 cm)
- **_Pourouma_ species**: Produce edible fruits but latex is not typically consumed

**Key identification features for _Brosimum lactescens_**:

- **Elevation**: 0-1600 m, preferring 300-1200 m in premontane humid forests
- **Latex**: Copious, sweet, edible white latex from any wound
- **Leaves**: 8-18 cm long, oblong-elliptic, alternate, evergreen, glossy above
- **Fruits**: Small spherical orange-red syncarps, 1.5-2.5 cm diameter
- **Habitat**: Humid montane forests with year-round rainfall
- **Bark**: Gray-brown, relatively smooth, exuding abundant white latex when cut

## Identification Guide

### Field Identification Key

1. **Habitat**: Premontane to lower montane humid forest (300-1200 m) → consistent with _B. lactescens_
2. **Make small cut in bark**: Abundant white latex flows → confirms _Brosimum_ genus
3. **Taste latex** (if confirmed non-toxic species): Sweet, pleasant flavor → confirms edible species (_B. lactescens_ or _B. utile_)
4. **Check elevation**: Above 800 m in montane forest → likely _B. lactescens_
5. **Leaves**: 8-18 cm long, oblong-elliptic, glossy above → consistent
6. **Fruits** (if present): Orange-red spherical syncarps 1.5-2.5 cm → confirms _B. lactescens_

### Seasonal Identification

- **March-May**: Flowering season; small greenish-yellow globose flower heads visible in leaf axils
- **June-September**: Fruiting season; orange-red spherical fruits conspicuous
- **Rainy season**: Most abundant latex flow; best time for tapping
- **Year-round**: White latex visible from any wound; evergreen foliage

### Key Distinguishing Features

**Absolutely diagnostic features**:

1. **Edible white latex**: The abundant, sweet, milky latex is the most distinctive feature—no other common Costa Rican tree has this characteristic
2. **Elevation range**: Premontane forest preference (300-1200 m) distinguishes from lowland relative _B. utile_
3. **Fruit structure**: Orange-red spherical syncarps are characteristic of _Brosimum_ genus

**Caution**: Always be absolutely certain of identification before consuming any plant latex—while _Brosimum_ species have edible latex, most latex-producing tropical trees have toxic or irritating latex. If in doubt, consult with local experts or botanists.
