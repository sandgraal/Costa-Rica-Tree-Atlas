# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "low"
toxicParts:
  - "seeds"
skinContactRisk: "moderate"
allergenRisk: "moderate"
structuralRisks:
  - "sharp-spines"
  - "falling-branches"
childSafe: false
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: true
toxicityDetails: "The tree itself has low toxicity. Seeds are embedded in kapok fiber and are not typically eaten - they contain oils that may cause mild gastrointestinal upset if consumed in quantity but are not considered highly toxic. The main concerns are physical rather than chemical toxicity."
skinContactDetails: "Young trees have SHARP CONICAL SPINES on trunk and branches that can cause painful puncture wounds. Spines are particularly prominent on juvenile trees and lower trunk; older trees often lose spines on upper portions. Wear thick gloves and long sleeves when working near young ceiba trees. The KAPOK FIBER from seed pods can cause skin and respiratory irritation in sensitive individuals - the fine fibers act as mechanical irritants. Handling kapok may cause itching and discomfort."
allergenDetails: "Kapok fiber can cause respiratory irritation and allergic reactions when inhaled. The fine, silky fibers can irritate airways causing coughing and difficulty breathing. Some individuals may develop sensitivity to kapok. Historically used in pillows and life jackets but largely replaced due to allergy concerns. Pollen may cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals during flowering season."
structuralRiskDetails: "MASSIVE FALLING BRANCHES: This is one of the world's tallest tropical trees, reaching 60-70 meters with a broad crown. Large branches can fall without warning, especially during storms or as tree ages. NEVER plant near buildings, power lines, or high-traffic areas. Requires substantial space and professional assessment. BUTTRESS ROOTS: Develops massive buttress roots that can damage sidewalks, foundations, and underground utilities. SPINES: Trunk covered in sharp pyramidal spines (especially when young) that pose injury risk."
safetyNotes: "This magnificent tree is generally safe but requires respect due to its enormous size and physical hazards. SPINES: Young trees have very sharp spines - keep children away and use caution. NOT suitable for small residential lots. Requires professional arborist care due to size. Best planted in parks, large estates, or preserved natural areas. Sacred status means it's often protected - check local regulations before cutting or trimming."
wildlifeRisks: "Generally safe for wildlife. Seeds are eaten by various birds and mammals. Not toxic to pets, but spines could injure curious animals. Keep pets away from young spiny trees."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "fast"
growthRateDetails: "4-6 ft/year when young in ideal conditions; one of the fastest-growing tropical trees; can reach 30m in 15 years"
matureSize: "50-70 m tall (165-230 ft), crown spread 30-40 m; among tallest trees in Central America"
hardiness: "Tropical lowlands 0-1000m; prefers consistently moist conditions; not drought-tolerant"
soilRequirements: "Deep, moist, well-drained soils; grows best in alluvial soils near water; pH 5.0-7.0; poor performance in shallow or dry soils"
waterNeeds: "high"
waterDetails: "Requires consistent moisture, especially when young. Not drought-tolerant - needs regular rainfall or irrigation. Naturally grows in moist tropical forests and near rivers. Young trees need deep watering twice weekly during dry periods."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"

spacing: "Plant MINIMUM 30-40 m (100-130 ft) from buildings, power lines, structures; needs enormous space - only suitable for very large properties, parks, or natural forest settings"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
  - "large cuttings"
propagationDifficulty: "moderate"
plantingSeason: "Plant at start of rainy season (May-June); requires reliable moisture for establishment"
maintenanceNeeds: "REQUIRES PROFESSIONAL CARE due to extreme size. Young trees (1-5 years): protect from wind, provide consistent water, remove competing vegetation. SPINE HAZARD when pruning - use extreme caution and protective equipment. Formative pruning to develop strong structure in years 3-7. Mature trees should only be worked on by certified arborists - branch failure can be fatal. Do NOT attempt to climb or work on mature Ceibas without professional equipment and training."
commonProblems:
  - "DANGEROUS SPINES - young trees have sharp trunk spines causing painful injuries; wear thick gloves and long sleeves"
  - "Kapok fiber irritation - seed pod fiber causes skin and respiratory irritation in some people"
  - "Massive size inappropriate for small properties - requires 1+ acre minimum"
  - "Buttress roots damage sidewalks, driveways, building foundations if planted too close"
  - "Falling branches from mature trees - can cause property damage or injury"
  - "Wind damage to young trees - stake for first 2-3 years in exposed locations"
  - "Poor establishment if planted in dry season without irrigation"
  - "NOT drought-tolerant - will decline without adequate water"

# Ceiba

<Callout type="tip" title="The World Tree">
  **Ceiba** (_Ceiba pentandra_), also known as the Kapok Tree, is one of the
  most culturally significant trees in Mesoamerica. The ancient Maya revered it
  as the sacred **World Tree (Ya'axché)** — the axis connecting Xibalba (the
  underworld), the earthly realm, and the thirteen heavens above.

## Cultural & Spiritual Significance

<Callout type="info" title="The Maya World Tree — Ya'axché">

To the ancient Maya, the Ceiba was the **most sacred of all trees** — the
_Ya'axché_ (Green Tree). It represented the _axis mundi_, the cosmic axis
connecting:

<SimpleList
  items={[
    "🌍 **The Roots** — Xibalba, the underworld of the dead",
    "🌳 **The Trunk** — The earthly realm of humans",
    "🌌 **The Branches** — The thirteen levels of heaven",

/>

The Ceiba's spreading branches were seen as supporting the sky, while its roots
reached into the realm of the dead. Maya rulers were often depicted with the
World Tree, and Ceibas were planted in town plazas as sacred centers.

<Callout type="tip" title="Finding Sacred Ceibas">
  Many Central American towns have ancient Ceiba trees in their central plazas —

## Sustainability & Conservation

<Callout type="success" title="Conservation Status">
  The Ceiba pentandra is listed as "Least Concern" globally due to its wide
  distribution across multiple continents. However, **large old-growth

  heritage trees are often protected by local law.

_The Ceiba (Ceiba pentandra) stands as one of the most magnificent and spiritually significant trees of the American tropics. Rising to heights of 70 meters with buttresses that seem to grow from another world, flowering in spectacular displays that draw bats from across the forest, and holding a central place in Maya cosmology as the World Tree — the Ceiba represents the very essence of tropical grandeur._

_When you stand beneath an ancient Ceiba, you stand at the center of a Maya universe._
