## Physical Description

### Overall Form

Poró Gigante is a tall, fast-growing tree with a broad, spreading crown that provides excellent shade coverage. The trunk often develops buttresses at the base and may have scattered thorns when young. During the dry season, it loses its leaves and produces masses of brilliant orange-red flowers—a spectacular sight across coffee-growing regions.

## Role in Coffee Cultivation

### The Perfect Shade Tree

<Callout type="success" title="Sustainable Partnership">
  The relationship between Poró and coffee is one of the most successful
  examples of agroforestry in the world. Poró provides filtered shade (reducing
  coffee plant stress), fixes nitrogen (fertilizing the soil naturally), drops
  leaves that become mulch, and can be pruned for firewood—all while allowing
  enough light for coffee production.
</Callout>

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Benefits for Coffee

- **Shade**: Reduces temperature extremes
- **Nitrogen fixation**: Natural fertilization
- **Mulch**: Leaf litter enriches soil
- **Wind protection**: Shelters delicate plants
- **Soil conservation**: Prevents erosion
- **Carbon storage**: Climate mitigation

</Column>
<Column>

#### Management Practices

- **Pollarding**: Regular pruning for light control
- **Coppicing**: Cut back to regrow
- **Timing**: Prune after flowering
- **Spacing**: 12-15m between trees
- **Density**: 70-150 trees per hectare
- **Integration**: Mixed with other species

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

### Shade-Grown vs. Sun Coffee

    ["Biodiversity", "High - many bird species", "Low - monoculture"],

    ["Flavor", "Often more complex", "Variable"],
    ["Sustainability", "Long-term viable", "Soil depletion issues"],
  ]}
/>

## Nitrogen Fixation

### Natural Fertilizer Factory

<Callout type="info" title="Symbiotic Relationship">
  Like other legumes, Poró Gigante hosts nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Rhizobium)
  in nodules on its roots. These bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into
  forms plants can use. A single Poró tree can add 30-60 kg of nitrogen per
  hectare annually—equivalent to significant fertilizer inputs.
</Callout>

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### How It Works

1. Rhizobium bacteria enter root hairs
2. Form specialized nodules
3. Bacteria fix atmospheric N₂
4. Convert to ammonia (NH₃)
5. Tree shares sugars with bacteria
6. Nitrogen enriches surrounding soil

</Column>
<Column>

#### Ecosystem Benefits

- Reduces need for synthetic fertilizers
- Improves soil structure
- Supports soil microbiome
- Benefits neighboring plants
- Sustainable long-term fertility
- Climate-friendly agriculture

## Distribution in Costa Rica

<Callout type="info" title="Where to Find It">
  Poró Gigante dominates the landscape of Costa Rica's coffee-growing regions,
  particularly in the Central Valley and surrounding mountains. From January to
  April, the flowering trees create rivers of orange-red color visible from
  hillsides and mountain viewpoints.
</Callout>

### Propagation Methods

<Callout type="info" title="Easy to Propagate">
  Poró Gigante is exceptionally easy to propagate from large branch cuttings
  (estacas). Branches 10-20cm diameter and 2-3m long can be planted directly
  as living fence posts—they root and grow into full trees. This makes
  establishment fast and cheap for farmers.
</Callout>

## Interesting Facts

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="⚠️ Toxic Seeds">

Despite its many uses, Poró Gigante seeds are poisonous. They contain erythrina
alkaloids that affect the nervous system. Indigenous peoples used seed extracts
for arrow poison and fish stunning. The bright red color may serve as a warning
to would-be seed predators.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🏔️ Volcanic Soil Connection">

The association between Poró and coffee in Costa Rica's Central Valley is no
accident. Both thrive on the rich volcanic soils of the region. The tree's
nitrogen-fixing ability compensates for nutrients leached by heavy rainfall,
making the combination particularly successful on these young volcanic soils.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="⏱️ Living Fence Posts">

Large Poró branches stuck in the ground readily take root and grow into trees.
Farmers have used this for generations to create living fences—posts that
grow, need no replacement, provide shade, fix nitrogen, and produce flowers for
pollinators. A true multi-purpose solution.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🌍 Climate Smart Agriculture">

As climate change threatens coffee production, shade trees like Poró are
increasingly valued. They moderate temperature extremes, provide insurance
against drought, store carbon, and maintain ecosystem functions. The
traditional shade-coffee system is now seen as a model for climate-resilient
agriculture.
