toxicParts:
  - "seeds"
  - "bark"
  - "roots"
skinContactRisk: "low"
allergenRisk: "low"
structuralRisks: []
childSafe: false
petSafe: false
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "Like many members of the genus Lonchocarpus, Chirraca contains rotenone and related rotenoids in its bark, roots, and seeds. Rotenone is a naturally occurring insecticide and fish poison (ichthyotoxin) that has been used by indigenous peoples throughout the Americas for centuries to stun fish for easy capture. While rotenone is moderately toxic to mammals if ingested in large quantities, the concentrations in most parts of the tree are not dangerously high for incidental contact. The leaves and wood are not significantly toxic. Seeds and bark should not be ingested. No fatal poisonings from this species have been documented, but the related L. urucu (barbasco) is used commercially as a botanical pesticide."
skinContactDetails: "Low skin contact risk. The wood, leaves, and bark do not cause contact dermatitis in most people. Sawdust from the wood may cause mild respiratory irritation during prolonged exposure, as with most hardwoods. Sap does not typically irritate skin. No phototoxic compounds are known."
allergenDetails: "Low allergen risk. The flowers produce moderate pollen but are primarily insect-pollinated, so airborne pollen concentrations are low. The wood dust may cause mild respiratory sensitization with prolonged occupational exposure. No significant cross-reactivity with common allergens."
structuralRiskDetails: "Minimal structural risk. The wood is dense and hard, with good resistance to wind damage. The tree develops a strong root system adapted to seasonal drought. Branches are well-attached and not prone to failure. The tree sheds its leaves during the dry season but this does not create hazardous conditions."
safetyNotes: "Chirraca contains rotenone compounds in its bark, roots, and seeds — a natural insecticide historically used for fishing. While not acutely dangerous from incidental contact, seeds and bark should not be ingested, especially by children or pets. The wood and leaves are not significantly toxic. The tree itself poses minimal structural or contact hazards. Not recommended for planting in areas with small children who might eat seeds. Exercise caution if processing bark or roots."
wildlifeRisks: "Natural rotenone content is important ecological context. While rotenone is toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates, terrestrial wildlife is generally not affected at natural concentrations. The flowers are visited by numerous pollinators including bees and butterflies. The seeds are eaten by some parrot species that have adapted to tolerate rotenoids. As a legume, the tree fixes atmospheric nitrogen, benefiting surrounding soil organisms and plants. The deciduous canopy allows seasonal light penetration that diversifies understorey habitats."
# Care and Cultivation
growthRate: "moderate"
growthRateDetails: "Moderate growth rate of 0.5-1 meter per year in height under favorable conditions; somewhat faster in deep soils with adequate moisture; reaches reproductive maturity in 5-8 years from seed; typical dry forest tree growth pattern — faster during rainy season, dormant or very slow during dry season"
matureSize: "10-20 m tall; trunk diameter 20-50 cm; crown spread 6-12 m; broad, spreading, rounded crown when open-grown; more upright and narrower in forest settings"
hardiness: "Tropical dry forest species; elevation 0-800m; temperature 22-35°C; highly drought-tolerant once established; tolerates seasonal rainfall patterns with 4-6 month dry season; moderately wind-resistant; not frost-tolerant"
soilRequirements: "Adapted to a range of dry forest soils including rocky, shallow, and calcareous substrates typical of the Guanacaste region; tolerates clay, loam, and sandy soils; pH 5.5-7.5; performs well on nutrient-poor soils due to nitrogen-fixing capability via symbiotic rhizobial bacteria; prefers well-drained soils and does not tolerate prolonged waterlogging"
waterNeeds: "low"
waterDetails: "Low water needs once established. As a dry forest species, Chirraca is highly adapted to seasonal drought. The tree is deciduous, shedding its leaves during the dry season to conserve water — a key adaptation to 4-6 months with minimal rainfall. During the rainy season, growth and flowering are vigorous. In cultivation, water young trees during their first 1-2 dry seasons; established trees require no supplemental irrigation."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plant 6-10 m apart for reforestation; 8-12 m for shade trees; excellent in mixed-species dry forest restoration plantings; can be planted in hedgerows or living fence lines at 3-4 m spacing"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
  - "cuttings"
propagationDifficulty: "moderate"
plantingSeason: "Plant at the beginning of the rainy season (May-June) when soil moisture is reliable; seeds germinate best when scarified (nicked or soaked in hot water) before planting; direct seeding and nursery-raised seedlings both work well"
maintenanceNeeds: "Low maintenance once established. Drought-tolerant and adapted to poor soils. No irrigation needed after establishment. Light pruning can shape the crown if desired. The tree naturally sheds leaves in the dry season — this is normal, not a sign of stress. No fertilization needed due to nitrogen-fixing capability. Fire management may be needed in fire-prone areas during dry season."
commonProblems:
  - "Slow initial establishment compared to faster-growing pioneer species"
  - "Susceptible to bark damage from fire during dry season — protect trunk of young trees"
  - "Seeds contain rotenone — keep away from children and pets"
  - "Leaf drop during dry season may be undesirable in landscape settings"
  - "Limited availability in nurseries — may need to collect seed from wild trees"
  - "Vulnerable to cattle browsing when young — protect seedlings in pastoral settings"

# Chirraca

<Callout type="info" title="The Nitrogen Fixer of Costa Rica's Dry Forests">
  **Chirraca** (_Lonchocarpus minimiflorus_) is one of the unsung heroes of
  Costa Rica's threatened tropical dry forests — a medium-sized deciduous legume
  tree that performs the invisible but essential work of enriching impoverished
  soils through biological nitrogen fixation. During the brief but spectacular
  flowering season, Chirraca transforms into cascades of small lavender-purple
  flowers that attract clouds of bees and butterflies, making it one of the most
  beautiful dry forest trees in bloom. Its dense, durable wood has been valued
  for centuries by rural communities for fence posts, tools, and construction.
  As a critical component of one of the world's most endangered ecosystems — the
  Mesoamerican tropical dry forest — Chirraca deserves far more attention than
  it receives.

## General Description

_Lonchocarpus minimiflorus_ is a member of the vast legume family (Fabaceae), one of the largest and most ecologically important plant families on Earth. The genus _Lonchocarpus_ contains approximately 150 species distributed throughout the neotropics, many of which are notable for their production of rotenone — a natural insecticide that has been used by indigenous peoples for fish stunning throughout the Americas for millennia.

Within this genus, _L. minimiflorus_ (literally "smallest-flowered lance pod") is distinguished by its relatively small flowers, its preference for dry forest habitats, and its importance as a nitrogen-fixing pioneer in degraded dry forest landscapes. The common name "Chirraca" is used primarily in Costa Rica and appears to be of indigenous origin, though its precise etymology is uncertain. Other names include "Chaperno Negro" (black chaperno) referring to the dark heartwood.

In Costa Rica, Chirraca is primarily found in the tropical dry forests of the Pacific lowlands — particularly in Guanacaste province, one of the last strongholds of Mesoamerican tropical dry forest. This ecosystem has been reduced to approximately 2% of its original extent across Central America, making every remaining dry forest tree species of conservation concern regardless of its individual IUCN status. Chirraca plays a disproportionately important role in this ecosystem because of its nitrogen-fixing capability, which enriches depleted soils and facilitates the recovery of dry forest after disturbance.

The tree is deciduous, dramatically dropping all its leaves during the 4-6 month dry season (December-May) — one of the most severe seasonal droughts faced by any tropical forest anywhere in the world. When the rains return in May-June, Chirraca bursts back to life with a flush of new leaves and flowers. This cycle of drought dormancy and rain-season vigor is characteristic of the remarkable adaptations of dry forest trees.

The wood of _L. minimiflorus_ is notably dense, hard, and durable — prized by rural communities for fence posts that last decades in the ground without treatment. This durability is partly due to the presence of rotenoids and other secondary compounds that make the wood resistant to insects and decay.

### Taxonomic Notes

_Lonchocarpus minimiflorus_ was first described by Donn. Sm. in 1903. The genus name _Lonchocarpus_ comes from Greek _lonche_ (lance) and _karpos_ (fruit), referring to the lance-shaped seed pods characteristic of the genus. The species epithet _minimiflorus_ means "smallest-flowered," distinguishing it from larger-flowered relatives. The genus _Lonchocarpus_ has historically been somewhat confused with _Derris_ — both genera produce rotenone and share morphological features — but molecular studies have confirmed their separation. Some authorities have synonymized certain species within _Lonchocarpus_, and the taxonomy of the Central American dry forest species is still being refined.

## Physical Description

### Growth Form

Chirraca is a medium-sized deciduous tree with a broad, spreading crown. It typically reaches 10-20 meters in height, with a single straight to slightly sinuous trunk. The crown is rounded, spreading, and relatively dense during the rainy season when fully leafed out, and displays an attractive branching architecture when bare during the dry season. The tree is symmetrical and well-proportioned when open-grown.

### Trunk

The trunk is straight and cylindrical, 20-50 cm in diameter, with dark gray to blackish-brown bark that is moderately fissured and somewhat rough. The bark pattern consists of narrow, irregular longitudinal fissures with flat-topped ridges. Inner bark is pinkish to brownish. The heartwood is dark brown to nearly black (hence "Chaperno Negro"), extremely hard and dense, with a specific gravity of 0.7-0.9. Sapwood is paler yellowish-brown.

### Leaves

The leaves are pinnately compound (odd-pinnate), 10-25 cm long, with 7-15 leaflets. Leaflets are opposite, oblong-elliptic, 3-7 cm long and 1.5-3 cm wide, with entire margins and rounded to slightly notched tips. The upper surface is dark green and slightly glossy; the lower surface is paler with fine pubescence. New leaf flush occurs with the first rains in May-June, coinciding with or slightly preceding flowering. Leaves are shed completely during the dry season (December-February), an important water conservation adaptation.

### Flowers

The flowers are small (5-8 mm long, hence "minimiflorus"), papilionaceous (butterfly-shaped, typical of legumes), and displayed in axillary racemes 5-15 cm long. Flower color ranges from lavender to light purple, sometimes with pink or white tones. Individual flowers have the standard, wings, and keel arrangement characteristic of Fabaceae subfamily Papilionoideae. The flowers are lightly fragrant and produced in profusion, giving the tree a spectacular purple haze when in full bloom. Peak flowering is February-April during the dry season, before or concurrent with new leaf flush — one of the Guanacaste dry forest's signature visual events.

### Fruits and Seeds

The fruits are typical legume pods (legumes), flattened, oblong, 4-8 cm long and 1-1.5 cm wide, thin and papery, containing 1-3 seeds. The pods are initially green, maturing to brown. They are indehiscent (not splitting open on the tree) and are dispersed by wind. Seeds are kidney-shaped, 8-12 mm long, brown, with a hard seed coat that requires scarification for germination. Pods mature April-July.

### Ecological Role

_Lonchocarpus minimiflorus_ performs several critical ecological functions:

- **Nitrogen fixation**: As a legume, Chirraca hosts symbiotic Rhizobium bacteria in root nodules that convert atmospheric nitrogen (N₂) into biologically available forms, enriching impoverished dry forest soils
- **Soil improvement**: Nitrogen-rich leaf litter decomposes to improve soil fertility, facilitating succession by other species
- **Pollinator support**: Spectacular flowering during the dry season provides critical nectar and pollen when few other trees are in bloom
- **Dry season resource**: One of the first trees to flower in the dry season, providing essential resources when most other species are dormant
- **Fire resilience**: Thick bark and deep roots enable survival of the dry season fires that periodically sweep through Guanacaste dry forests
- **Canopy structure**: Provides mid-canopy architecture in dry forest, creating habitat stratification
- **Seed dispersal**: Wind-dispersed pods enable colonization of new areas

### Dry Season Deciduousness

The most dramatic ecological feature of Chirraca is its complete leaf drop during the dry season. This is a water-conservation strategy shared by most Guanacaste dry forest trees:

1. **November-December**: Leaves begin to yellow as soil moisture declines
2. **January-February**: Complete leaf drop; tree enters dormancy
3. **February-April**: Flowering occurs on bare branches — maximizing flower visibility to pollinators
4. **May-June**: Rains begin; rapid new leaf flush and fruit maturation
5. **July-November**: Full canopy; active growth and nitrogen fixation

This cycle means Chirraca contributes to soil fertility during the rainy season but reduces water competition during drought — an elegant adaptation to the extreme seasonality of tropical dry forests.

## Uses and Applications

### Nitrogen-Fixing Reforestation

Chirraca's greatest value lies in ecological restoration:

- **Soil rehabilitation**: Nitrogen fixation enriches degraded pastures and former agricultural lands, preparing the soil for other species
- **Nurse species**: Improves soil conditions that enable establishment of other dry forest species
- **Mixed plantings**: Excellent paired with non-nitrogen-fixing species like _Guanacaste_ (Enterolobium), _Pochote_ (Pachira quinata), and _Cocobolo_ (Dalbergia retusa)
- **Pasture-to-forest conversion**: One of the most effective species for transitioning degraded cattle pastures back to dry forest
- **Carbon sequestration**: Dense hardwood stores significant carbon per unit volume

### Timber and Construction

The wood of Chirraca has been valued by rural Guanacastecan communities for centuries:

- **Fence posts**: Heartwood is exceptionally durable in ground contact, lasting 15-25 years without treatment — the gold standard for tropical fence posts
- **Construction**: Dense wood used for structural elements, especially where insect resistance is needed
- **Tool handles**: Hardness and shock resistance make it excellent for agricultural tool handles
- **Firewood**: Dense wood produces long-lasting coals; excellent fuel wood
- **Charcoal**: Produces high-quality charcoal due to wood density

### Traditional Medicine

- **Bark preparations**: Used in folk medicine for digestive ailments and as an anthelmintic (dewormer)
- **Root preparations**: Historically used in extremely dilute form for parasitic infections (use with caution due to rotenone content)
- **Leaf poultices**: Applied to skin irritations and minor wounds

### Historical Fishing Use

Like other _Lonchocarpus_ species, the roots and bark of Chirraca contain rotenone, a natural fish toxin. Indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica crushed the bark and roots and placed them in pools of water to stun fish, which could then be easily collected. This practice — called "barbasco" fishing — was widespread throughout the Americas and persisted into the 20th century. While effective, rotenone-based fishing is now restricted or illegal in most jurisdictions due to its non-selective impact on aquatic ecosystems.

---

## Cultural and Historical Significance

Chirraca is culturally embedded in the ranching and farming traditions of Guanacaste — Costa Rica's most iconic cowboy province. The tree's exceptional fence post wood made it a valued species on every hacienda, and old fence lines of Chirraca posts are a characteristic feature of the Guanacastecan landscape. Experienced ranchers could identify the tree instantly and knew exactly when to harvest the wood for maximum durability.

The name "Chirraca" is used specifically in Costa Rica and appears in local toponyms, farm names, and folk knowledge. It belongs to the rich vocabulary of tree names that Guanacastecan farmers use to navigate and manage their landscape — alongside names like Guanacaste, Pochote, Cocobolo, Cenízaro, and Espavel. This traditional botanical knowledge, once passed from parent to child, is increasingly at risk as rural populations urbanize and dry forest landscapes are converted.

The broader genus _Lonchocarpus_ has deep cultural significance throughout the Americas due to the rotenone fish-stunning tradition. The practice of "barbasco" fishing is mentioned in accounts of nearly every indigenous culture in the tropical Americas and represents one of the most widespread examples of indigenous ecological knowledge — understanding and harnessing plant chemistry for food procurement.

The dry forests of Guanacaste province, where Chirraca grows, have their own cultural identity deeply intertwined with the "sabanero" (cowboy) tradition. The seasonal rhythm of dry forest trees — leafless and dusty in the dry season, explosively green in the rains — mirrors the rhythms of cattle ranching that has shaped the landscape for centuries.

## Conservation Status

<Callout
  type="warning"
  title="Least Concern — but Ecosystem is Critically Threatened"
>
  _Lonchocarpus minimiflorus_ is classified as **Least Concern (LC)** as a
  species, but its primary habitat — Mesoamerican tropical dry forest — has been
  reduced to approximately **2% of its original extent** in Central America. The
  tree survives in remnant forest patches, living fence lines, secondary growth,
  and protected areas, but the ecosystem it belongs to is among the world's most
  endangered.
</Callout>

### Dry Forest Conservation Context

The conservation story of Chirraca cannot be separated from the broader crisis of tropical dry forest:

- **Historical loss**: Central American dry forest originally covered ~550,000 km²; less than 2% remains in intact condition
- **Guanacaste restoration**: Costa Rica's Área de Conservación Guanacaste (ACG) is one of the world's most ambitious dry forest restoration projects, where species like Chirraca are naturally recolonizing former pasturelands
- **Living fence lines**: In fragmented landscapes, Chirraca fence posts (which often sprout and grow) serve as critical connectors between forest fragments
- **Secondary succession**: The species persists well in secondary growth and degraded landscapes, giving it resilience even as primary forest disappears
- **Seed source**: Remaining Chirraca trees in pastures and fence lines serve as essential seed sources for natural dry forest regeneration

### Conservation Priority

While Chirraca itself is not in immediate danger, supporting its habitat is critical:

- Protect remaining dry forest fragments in Guanacaste
- Include Chirraca in all dry forest restoration plantings
- Maintain living fence lines that contain Chirraca
- Support the Área de Conservación Guanacaste restoration program
- Document traditional knowledge about Chirraca's uses and ecology

---

## Growing Chirraca

### Site Selection

Chirraca is adapted to the demanding conditions of tropical dry forest:

- **Full sun** — requires open, sunny conditions; does not tolerate heavy shade
- **Dry climate** — best in areas with distinct dry season (4-6 months); 1,000-2,000 mm annual rainfall
- **Well-drained soil** — tolerates rocky, shallow, and calcareous soils; does not tolerate waterlogging
- **Low to mid elevation** — 0-800 m; lowland to lower premontane zones
- **Heat-tolerant** — thrives in the 25-35°C temperatures typical of Guanacaste

Ideal for: dry forest restoration, living fence lines, nitrogen-fixing companion planting, agroforestry, shade for livestock, erosion control on dry hillsides.

### Propagation

**From seed**: Collect mature brown pods from April to July. Extract seeds and scarify the hard seed coat — either nick with a knife, rub on sandpaper, or soak in hot (not boiling) water for 12-24 hours. Unscarified seeds may take months to germinate or fail entirely. Sow in well-drained nursery mix, 1-2 cm deep. Keep at 25-30°C. Germination occurs in 7-21 days after scarification. Grow seedlings in nursery for 3-6 months before field planting.

**From cuttings**: Hardwood cuttings can be rooted, though success rates are variable. Take 20-30 cm cuttings from semi-mature wood during the rainy season. Treat with rooting hormone and plant in moist, well-drained medium.

### Planting and Care

- Plant at the beginning of the rainy season (May-June) for best establishment
- Prepare planting holes 30x30x30 cm; no fertilizer needed (nitrogen-fixing)
- Water regularly during the first dry season only
- No irrigation needed after first 1-2 years
- Protect young trees from cattle browsing and fire
- No pruning necessary unless shaping for specific purposes
- The tree will drop its leaves during the dry season — this is completely normal
- Expect moderate growth; the tree prioritizes root development and wood density over rapid height gain

## Where to See Chirraca

### In Costa Rica

- **Santa Rosa National Park** (Guanacaste): One of the best-protected dry forests in Central America; look for Chirraca in the forest interior and along trails
- **Palo Verde National Park**: Present in dry forest sections of this wetland-dry forest complex
- **Barra Honda National Park**: Found on the limestone hills with characteristic dry forest vegetation
- **Hacienda Solimar** (Guanacaste): Private reserve with good dry forest in various successional stages
- **Guanacaste rural roadsides**: Look for the tree along fence lines and in pasture remnants throughout Guanacaste province — old Chirraca fence posts that have sprouted into living trees are a common sight
- **Liberia to Nicoya road**: Dry forest patches along this route contain the species
- **Área de Conservación Guanacaste (ACG)**: The flagship dry forest restoration area; Chirraca is one of many species naturally recolonizing former pastures

### Viewing Tips

Chirraca is most spectacular during the dry season flowering period (February-April), when the tree produces cascades of small lavender-purple flowers on leafless branches. This is also the best time to identify the tree, as the flowers and bare branching architecture are distinctive. During the rainy season, the pinnately compound leaves with their paired leaflets help identify it. The dark, fissured bark is another field character. Old fence posts that have sprouted into living trees are another way to encounter this species in the Guanacaste landscape — they tell the story of the tree's remarkable durability and vitality.
