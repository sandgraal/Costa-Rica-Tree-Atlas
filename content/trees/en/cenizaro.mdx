toxicityDetails: "All parts of the Rain Tree are considered MILDLY TOXIC if ingested due to tannins, saponins, and glucosides. HUMAN RISK: Children may experience gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, and mild allergic reactions if they chew or swallow leaves, bark, or seeds. Symptoms are typically mild and self-limiting, but supervision is advised. Severe toxicity is rare but possible in sensitive individuals. PET RISK (Dogs & Cats): Mildly toxic with potential for gastrointestinal upset or skin irritation if consumed. Contact veterinarian if pet shows illness after exposure. LIVESTOCK: The sweet pulp inside mature seed pods is traditionally consumed by cattle, horses, and goats in tropical pastures with minimal adverse effects when eaten in normal quantities. Excessive consumption may cause mild digestive upset due to tannins and saponins, but severe toxic effects are rare under typical grazing conditions. The tree is often intentionally planted to provide pasture shade and improve soil fertility through nitrogen fixation."
skinContactDetails: "Direct contact with leaves, bark, and flowers is generally safe for most people with low irritation risk. Some sensitive individuals may experience mild skin irritation from prolonged handling. The tree does not have strong irritant sap or latex. Overall skin contact risk is low for casual interaction."
allergenDetails: "Low allergen risk overall. The compounds in the tree (tannins, saponins, glucosides) are not high-level allergens. Some sensitive individuals may have mild reactions. Wood dust is not documented as a significant respiratory sensitizer compared to other tropical hardwoods. Finished wood products (furniture, bowls) pose minimal risk."
safetyNotes: "SUPERVISION RECOMMENDED around children and pets. The main risk is MILD TOXICITY from curious children or pets chewing/eating plant parts - teach children not to taste leaves, bark, or seeds. Keep dogs and cats from gnawing on branches or eating fallen seeds. However, SEVERE poisoning is rare. For LIVESTOCK, pods are nutritious fodder in moderation - do not allow overconsumption. STRUCTURAL HAZARD: The massive spreading crown (up to 30m/100ft wide) means large branches can fall during storms or with age. Inspect regularly if tree is near paths, structures, or high-traffic areas. Do not plant where falling branches could damage property or injure people. Despite mild toxicity, Rain Tree is widely planted in public spaces for shade - risk is manageable with basic supervision and maintenance."

# Cenízaro (Rain Tree)

<Callout type="tip" title="The Great Shade-Giver">
  The **Cenízaro** (_Samanea saman_), known internationally as the Rain Tree or
  Monkey Pod, is perhaps the most magnificent shade tree of tropical America.
  Its enormous umbrella-shaped crown can spread **40-60 meters wide**, creating
  a living cathedral of shade that has sheltered generations of farmers, their
  livestock, and village gatherings. The tree is named "Rain Tree" because its
  leaves fold at night and before storms, and cicadas in its crown drip
  honeydew—seeming to make it "rain" beneath its canopy.

## Physical Description

### Overall Form

The Cenízaro has one of the most distinctive and beautiful forms of any tropical tree. Its trunk divides low into massive horizontal branches that spread outward in a perfectly symmetrical dome, creating a crown that is often **wider than the tree is tall**.

- **Bark**: Gray-brown, becoming rough with age
- **Shape**: One of the most symmetrical tree forms

#### Leaves

- **Type**: Bipinnately compound
- **Leaflets**: Small (6-16 pairs per pinna)
- **Movement**: Fold closed at night (nyctinasty)

- **Shade**: Creates dappled, not dense shade

</Column>
<Column>

#### Flowers

- **Type**: Powder-puff style (staminal)
- **Color**: Pink to reddish, fading to white
- **Size**: 5-6 cm across
- **Timing**: Dry season to early wet season

- **Shape**: Thick, curved, dark brown to black
- **Size**: 15-25 cm long, 2-3 cm wide
- **Pulp**: Sweet, sticky, edible
- **Seeds**: Hard, brown, numerous

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

<Callout type="tip" title="Why 'Rain Tree'?">
  The name "Rain Tree" comes from multiple phenomena: 1. **Leaf folding**:
  Leaves close at night and on cloudy days, allowing rain through 2. **Cicada
  honeydew**: Cicadas feeding in the crown produce sweet excrement that drips
  like rain 3. **Condensation**: The massive crown may concentrate morning dew
  Indigenous peoples noted that the grass beneath Rain Trees stays green in dry
  season, both from the "rain" and from nitrogen fixation by the tree's root
  nodules.

## Ecological Significance

### Ecosystem Services

<Callout type="success" title="Living Ecosystem">
  A mature Cenízaro tree is a complete ecosystem unto itself: - **Nitrogen
  fixation**: Enriches soil through root nodule bacteria - **Microclimate**:
  Crown creates cooler, moister conditions beneath - **Wildlife support**:
  Flowers attract pollinators; pods feed mammals - **Grass growth**: Pastures
  beneath are more productive - **Bird habitat**: Complex crown supports nesting
  and roosting Studies show pastures with scattered Cenízaro trees support
  higher livestock productivity than treeless pastures.
</Callout>

### Wildlife Interactions

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Pollinators

- **Bees**: Major pollinators, many species
- **Moths**: Nocturnal visitors
- **Bats**: Visit flowers at dusk

- **Horses**: Major dispersers in pastures
- **White-tailed Deer**: Wild consumers
- **Coatis**: Opportunistic consumers

</Column>

- **Parrots**: Nest in cavities
- **Owls**: Use hollow branches
- **Iguanas**: Bask on branches
- **Orchids**: Epiphytes in crown

#### Associated Insects

- **Cicadas**: Responsible for "rain" effect

## Cultural & Economic Importance

### Cultural Significance

<FeatureBox title="The Community Tree" icon="🌳">
  Throughout Latin America, the Cenízaro has been the traditional gathering
  place for communities. Village plazas were often located beneath these giants,
  where their shade could shelter markets, festivals, and daily social life. In
  Costa Rica's Guanacaste province, the Cenízaro competes with the Guanacaste
  tree as the quintessential symbol of the pastoral landscape—massive spreading
  crowns rising above the golden dry-season grass.

<Callout type="tip" title="Finding Cenízaro in Guanacaste">
  The best place to appreciate the Cenízaro is in Costa Rica's Guanacaste
  province, especially during the **dry season** (December-April) when the
  golden grass contrasts dramatically with the dark green crowns of scattered
  Cenízaros. Drive the roads between Liberia and Nicoya, stopping at any
  roadside view to see these magnificent trees. Look for cattle resting in their
  shade during the hot midday hours—this scene has defined Guanacaste for
  centuries.
