childSafe: true
petSafe: false
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "Cacao beans and chocolate products are safe for human consumption and have been eaten for thousands of years. However, raw cacao beans contain caffeine and theobromine (methylxanthine alkaloids) which are mildly stimulating to humans. Generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for human food use."
skinContactDetails: "Cacao products and tree parts are safe for skin contact. No irritation or allergic reactions from normal handling. Cocoa butter is widely used in cosmetics and skin care products."
allergenDetails: "True cacao/chocolate allergies are rare. Some individuals may be sensitive to compounds in chocolate causing mild reactions. Most 'chocolate allergies' are actually reactions to milk, soy, or other ingredients added to chocolate products rather than the cacao itself."
safetyNotes: "SAFE FOR HUMANS - The fruit pulp and processed chocolate are delicious and nutritious. Fresh cacao pulp is eaten directly from the pod and is completely safe. However, HIGHLY TOXIC TO PETS - see pet safety warning below."
wildlifeRisks: "EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO DOGS AND CATS. Theobromine in cacao is toxic to dogs, cats, and many other pets because they metabolize it much more slowly than humans. Even small amounts of chocolate can cause poisoning in dogs - symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, increased heart rate, seizures, and death. Dark chocolate and baking chocolate are most dangerous (highest theobromine). Keep ALL chocolate products and cacao pods away from pets. If pet ingests chocolate, seek immediate veterinary care. Also toxic to horses, parrots, and small mammals."

# Cacao (Chocolate Tree)

<Callout type="success" title="Food of the Gods">
  The **Cacao** tree (_Theobroma cacao_)—whose scientific name literally means
  "food of the gods"—is the source of all chocolate. This small understory tree
  has been cultivated by Mesoamerican peoples for over 4,000 years, first as a
  ceremonial beverage and currency, now as one of the world's most valuable
  tropical crops.

## Physical Description

### Overall Form

Cacao is a small, shade-loving understory tree with a distinctive growth pattern. It produces flowers and fruits directly from its trunk and main branches (cauliflory)—an unusual trait that allows pollinators and harvesters easy access. The large, colorful pods hanging from the trunk make it instantly recognizable.

## From Bean to Chocolate

### The Transformation Process

<Callout type="info" title="Complex Chemistry">
  Raw cacao beans taste nothing like chocolate—they're bitter and astringent.
  The familiar chocolate flavor only develops through careful fermentation,
  drying, roasting, and processing. This complex transformation was discovered
  by ancient Mesoamericans thousands of years ago.

## Distribution in Costa Rica

<Callout type="info" title="Where to Find It">
  Cacao thrives in Costa Rica's Caribbean lowlands where high rainfall and

## Interesting Facts

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="🪰 Tiny Essential Pollinators">

Cacao flowers are pollinated almost exclusively by tiny midges (Forcipomyia and
related genera) barely 1-3mm long. These insects breed in rotting leaf litter
on the forest floor. Without them, no chocolate! Maintaining leaf litter and
shade in cacao farms is essential for pollinator populations.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="💰 Ancient Currency">

Cacao beans were so valuable to the Aztecs that they were used as currency.
Records show prices like: 1 turkey = 100 beans, 1 avocado = 3 beans, 1 tamale
= 1 bean. Counterfeiting was a problem—some traders filled bean shells with
mud to pass them off as real currency!

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🧬 Genetic Diversity Center">

Recent genetic research suggests the Amazon basin, not Central America, is
cacao's original home. However, Central America—including Costa Rica—is where
it was first domesticated and where unique genetic varieties developed over
thousands of years of cultivation.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🍫 From Bitter to Sweet">

Ancient Mesoamerican chocolate was nothing like modern candy bars. It was a
bitter, spicy beverage mixed with chili peppers, vanilla, and sometimes corn.
Adding sugar to chocolate only happened after Europeans brought it back to
Spain and combined it with cane sugar—itself a relatively new crop in Europe.
