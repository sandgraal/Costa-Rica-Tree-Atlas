# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "low"
toxicParts:
  - "seeds"
skinContactRisk: "none"
allergenRisk: "low"
structuralRisks: []
childSafe: true
petSafe: false
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "Cacao seeds and chocolate are SAFE for humans but TOXIC TO PETS. The seeds contain theobromine, a compound similar to caffeine that humans can metabolize easily but dogs, cats, and some other animals cannot. For PETS, theobromine causes vomiting, diarrhea, rapid heart rate, tremors, seizures, and can be FATAL. Darker chocolate and raw cacao are more dangerous than milk chocolate due to higher theobromine content. For HUMANS, cacao is safe and nutritious—theobromine in normal amounts provides the pleasant stimulant effect of chocolate. Overconsumption can cause caffeine-like effects (jitteriness, insomnia) but is not dangerous."
safetyNotes: "Fresh cacao pods and processed chocolate are completely safe for human consumption. The tree itself poses no hazards—no toxic sap, no dangerous spines, no allergens. PRIMARY CONCERN: Keep chocolate and raw cacao beans away from pets. Even small amounts can be harmful to dogs and cats. If a pet ingests chocolate, contact a veterinarian immediately—time-sensitive treatment may be needed. For livestock, theobromine is also toxic. Cacao pod husks used as mulch should not be accessible to animals."
wildlifeRisks: "TOXIC TO DOGS, CATS, HORSES, and most domestic animals due to theobromine. Severity depends on amount consumed and animal size. Dark chocolate and raw cacao beans are most dangerous. Wild animals that co-evolved with cacao (like agoutis, monkeys) can consume small amounts safely but domestic animals cannot."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "moderate"
growthRateDetails: "Moderate growth; 0.5-1 m/year; begins flowering at 3-5 years; reaches mature production (6-8m tall) at 7-10 years; productive for 25-30 years"
matureSize: "4-8 m tall in cultivation (can reach 10-12m wild), crown spread 4-6 m; small understory tree ideal for agroforestry"
hardiness: "Tropical humid lowlands 0-800m; requires year-round warmth (20-30°C), high humidity (70%+), consistent rainfall (1500-2500mm); Caribbean slope ideal"
soilRequirements: "Deep, rich, well-drained soils with high organic matter; pH 6.0-7.0; cacao is shallow-rooted and needs nutrient-rich topsoil; benefits from mulch and compost; does not tolerate waterlogged or compacted soils"
waterNeeds: "high"
waterDetails: "High water needs year-round. Requires consistent moisture but not waterlogging. Young trees need frequent watering (3-4 times/week during dry periods). Mature trees need regular rainfall/irrigation - cannot tolerate extended drought. Thrives in humid Caribbean lowlands with short dry season."
lightRequirements: "partial-shade"
spacing: "Plant 3-4 m apart in commercial plantations; in agroforestry/shade systems plant under larger trees (banana, coconut, or tall forest trees providing 50% shade)"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
  - "grafting"
  - "budding"
propagationDifficulty: "moderate"
plantingSeason: "Plant at start of rainy season (May-June); fresh seeds germinate in 2-3 weeks but lose viability quickly; plant immediately after extraction from pod"
maintenanceNeeds: "MODERATE to HIGH maintenance crop tree. CRITICAL: Cacao must have shade, especially when young. Traditional agroforestry systems plant with bananas (quick shade) and timber trees (long-term shade). Years 1-3: provide 60-80% shade, weekly watering, organic fertilizer 3-4 times/year, prune to develop open vase shape. Years 4-10: reduce shade to 40-50%, continue fertilization, prune diseased/crossing branches, maintain trunk hygiene (remove chupons/suckers), apply mulch, harvest pods when ripe (color change). Control fungal diseases aggressively. Mature trees: annual maintenance pruning, disease monitoring, replace declining trees."
commonProblems:
  - "BLACK POD DISEASE (Phytophthora) - devastating fungal disease requiring fungicides, worse in wet conditions"
  - "WITCHES' BROOM disease - fungal disease causing abnormal growth, remove infected parts immediately"
  - "Monilia pod rot - another serious fungal disease, requires cultural controls and fungicides"
  - "Frosty pod rot - fungal disease especially in wet seasons"
  - "Insect pests: cocoa pod borer, mirids (capsids), thrips - integrated pest management needed"
  - "Squirrel/rat damage to pods - netting or traps may be needed"
  - "Poor yields without proper shade - needs shade tree management"
  - "Sunburn damage if grown in full sun - not adapted to direct light"

## From Bean to Chocolate

### The Transformation Process

<Callout type="info" title="Complex Chemistry">
  Raw cacao beans taste nothing like chocolate—they're bitter and astringent.
  The familiar chocolate flavor only develops through careful fermentation,
  drying, roasting, and processing. This complex transformation was discovered
  by ancient Mesoamericans thousands of years ago.

</PropertiesGrid>

### Natural Habitat

In the wild, _Theobroma cacao_ is an understory tree of lowland tropical rainforests. It evolved beneath the dense canopy of the Amazon basin and Central American forests, where it receives filtered light, constant humidity, and protection from wind. This evolutionary history makes cacao uniquely adapted to shaded environments—unlike most crop trees, it performs poorly in full sun.

In Costa Rica, wild or semi-wild cacao populations persist in the Caribbean lowlands, particularly in the Talamanca region where indigenous Bribri communities have maintained traditional cacao groves for centuries. These "jardines de cacao" (cacao gardens) blur the line between wild forest and managed cultivation.

### Ecological Role in Agroforestry

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Shade-Grown Benefits

- Maintains forest canopy structure
- Provides wildlife habitat comparable to natural forest
- Carbon storage in shade trees (2-3× more than full-sun plantations)
- Reduced erosion on slopes through understory root networks
- Natural pest control via habitat for predatory insects and birds
- Pollinator habitat preservation (leaf litter for midge breeding)
- Maintains soil moisture and microclimate stability

</Column>
<Column>

#### Wildlife in Cacao Farms

- **Primates**: White-faced capuchins, spider monkeys (eat pod pulp)
- **Birds**: 100+ species documented in shade-grown cacao, including migratory warblers
- **Midges**: _Forcipomyia_ spp. (essential, exclusive pollinators)
- **Bats**: Fruit bats assist seed dispersal
- **Agoutis**: Central American agoutis cache and disperse seeds
- **Lizards & frogs**: Anoles, poison dart frogs use bromeliad-cacao habitat
- **Beneficial insects**: Parasitoid wasps, predatory beetles

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

### The Midge-Cacao Mutualism

<Callout type="info" title="No Midges, No Chocolate">
  Cacao's tiny flowers (1-2 cm) can only be pollinated by equally tiny midges in
  the family Ceratopogonidae, primarily _Forcipomyia_ species. These flies are
  just 1-3 mm long—small enough to navigate the complex flower structure.
  Research shows that fewer than 5% of cacao flowers successfully set fruit,
  making pollination the primary bottleneck in chocolate production worldwide.
</Callout>

The ceratopogonid midges that pollinate cacao breed in decomposing organic matter on the forest floor—rotting leaves, decaying fruit, and banana stems. This is why traditional agroforestry systems with abundant leaf litter produce more cacao than "clean" plantations. Studies in Costa Rica's Talamanca region have shown that maintaining leaf litter and decomposing organic matter on the ground can increase pollination rates by 60-80%.

### Cacao and Biodiversity Conservation

Shade-grown cacao plantations serve as important biological corridors in fragmented tropical landscapes. In Costa Rica's Caribbean lowlands, where much of the original forest has been cleared for banana and cattle, cacao farms under diverse shade canopy provide:

- **Habitat connectivity** between forest fragments
- **Refuge for forest-dependent species** that cannot survive in open pastureland
- **Stepping stones for migratory birds** using the Caribbean flyway
- **Genetic reservoirs** for wild cacao and associated plant species

Research at CATIE (Centro Agronómico Tropical de Investigación y Enseñanza) in Turrialba has demonstrated that diversified cacao agroforests can harbor 60-70% of the bird species found in adjacent primary forest.

    ["Light", "50-70% shade", "Understory tree"],
    ["Time to Production", "3-5 years", "Full production at 8-10 years"],
  ]}
/>

### Propagation

**From Seed**: The most common method for smallholder farmers. Seeds (beans) must be planted within 1-2 weeks of extraction from the pod, as they lose viability rapidly—they have no dormancy period.

- **Collection**: Select ripe pods (color changes from green to yellow/orange/red depending on variety)
- **Extraction**: Split pods carefully, extract beans with surrounding pulp
- **Planting**: Sow 2-3 cm deep in nursery bags filled with rich, well-draining soil mix
- **Germination**: 7-14 days at 25-30°C with consistent moisture
- **Viability warning**: Seeds cannot be dried or stored—plant immediately

**Grafting**: Preferred for commercial plantations to ensure varietal consistency and disease resistance. Bud grafting or cleft grafting onto vigorous rootstock produces trees true to type that begin bearing 1-2 years earlier than seedlings.

**Budding**: Patch budding is widely used in Costa Rica, especially at CATIE where improved clones are distributed to farmers.

### Shade Management

<Callout type="warning" title="Shade is Non-negotiable">
  Cacao cannot be grown without shade. Direct sun causes leaf scorch, reduces
  yields, increases pest pressure, and dramatically shortens tree lifespan.
  Proper shade management is the single most important factor in successful
  cacao cultivation.
</Callout>

**Traditional Costa Rican shade system (recommended):**

1. **Temporary shade** (Years 0-3): Plant bananas (_Musa_ spp.) or plantains at 3 m spacing to provide 60-80% shade while permanent shade trees grow
2. **Medium-term shade** (Years 3-10): _Erythrina poeppigiana_ (Poró) or _Gliricidia sepium_ (Madero Negro)—nitrogen-fixing legume trees pruned to regulate shade
3. **Permanent canopy** (Year 10+): Timber trees like _Cordia alliodora_ (Laurel) or _Terminalia amazonia_ (Amarillón) at 15-20 m spacing, plus fruit trees like breadfruit or avocado

      "Maintain balanced shade, selective insecticides if severe",
    ],
  ]}
/>

### Growth Expectations

- **Year 1**: 50-80 cm growth; establish shade system, water regularly
- **Years 2-3**: 1-1.5 m/year; first flowers may appear (remove to strengthen tree)
- **Years 3-5**: First harvestable pods; 0.5-1 kg dried beans per tree
- **Years 5-8**: Production increasing; 1-2 kg dried beans per tree/year
- **Years 8-15**: Peak production; 2-3 kg dried beans per tree/year with good management
- **Years 15-30+**: Sustained production with declining vigor; consider renovation or replanting

### Companion Planting for Cacao

<Callout type="info" title="Traditional Agroforestry Wisdom">
  Cacao evolved as an understory tree in complex rainforest ecosystems.
  Traditional Costa Rican cacao farmers replicate this by creating multi-layered
  agroforests with complementary species—a practice that enhances biodiversity,
  soil health, and long-term productivity.
</Callout>

**Essential Shade Trees** (required for cacao survival):

**Temporary/Nursery Shade (Years 0-3)**:

- _Musa_ spp. (Banana/Plantain) - Rapid establishment, edible fruit, 3m spacing
- _Heliconia_ spp. - Ornamental, attracts pollinators
- Large-leaved _Xanthosoma_ (Taro relatives) - Ground-layer shade

**Medium-Term Nitrogen-Fixing Shade (Years 3-15)**:

- _Erythrina poeppigiana_ (Poró) - Traditional choice, excellent pruning response
- _Gliricidia sepium_ (Madero Negro) - Harder wood, living fence integration
- _Inga_ spp. (Guaba/Ice cream bean) - Edible pods, high organic matter production
- All provide green manure when pruned, eliminate fertilizer need

**Permanent Canopy Trees (Year 10+)**:

- _Cordia alliodora_ (Laurel) - Premium timber value, light filtered shade
- _Terminalia amazonia_ (Amarillón) - Valuable timber, minimal branch loss
- _Dipteryx panamensis_ (Almendro) - Endangered timber, wildlife food source
- _Persea americana_ (Avocado) - Fruit production + shade
- _Brosimum alicastrum_ (Ojoche/Ramon) - Wildlife tree, edible seeds
- _Artocarpus altilis_ (Breadfruit) - Food security, consistent shade

**Compatible Understory Crops**:

- _Xanthosoma_ and _Colocasia_ (Dasheen, Malanga) - Edible roots, shade-tolerant
- _Vanilla planifolia_ (Vanilla) - High-value spice, grows on cacao trunks
- Ginger (_Zingiber officinale_) and Turmeric (_Curcuma longa_) - Medicinal crops, compatible moisture needs
- _Piper auritum_ (Hoja santa) - Culinary herb, aromatic pest deterrent
- Shade coffee (_Coffea arabica_) - Compatible in 60-70% shade zones

**Plants to Avoid**:

- Fast-growing invasive species that create excessive shade (>80%)
- Allelopathic species (walnut family)
- Host plants for cocoa pests and diseases
- Species with aggressive surface roots competing with cacao
- Trees prone to branch drop (hazard to cacao canopy)

**Traditional Bribri Polyculture System** (recommended):
Indigenous cacao gardens (_kákaw_ in Bribri language) contain 40-60 plant species including:

- 3-4 canopy layers providing 50-70% shade
- Medicinal plants interspersed throughout
- Timber trees for future income
- Fruit trees for food security
- Sacred plants for ceremonial use

This system mimics natural forest, requires minimal inputs, and has sustained production for generations.

### Seasonal Care Calendar

**December-February (Dry Season)**:

- **Flowering peak** - Maintain consistent moisture despite reduced rainfall
- Supplemental irrigation critical if dry period exceeds 3 weeks
- Monitor trees closely for water stress (leaf wilting indicates emergency)
- Light mulching around base (10-15cm organic matter) retains soil moisture
- Scout for thrips and mirids (more active in dry season)
- Perform major pruning of shade trees to regulate light (aim for 50-60% shade)
- Remove diseased wood, dead branches, and witches' broom infections

**March-April (Early Rainy Season Transition)**:

- Reduce irrigation as rains begin
- Peak pod development season
- Apply balanced organic fertilizer (compost, aged manure) if not using nitrogen-fixing shade
- Monitor drainage as rain increases (cacao roots susceptible to waterlogging)
- Begin intensive black pod disease monitoring (Phytophthora thrives in wet conditions)
- Harvest ripe pods twice weekly (prevents overripening and pest colonization)
- Scout for frosty pod rot (white fungal growth on developing pods)

**May-August (Peak Rainy Season)**:

- **CRITICAL DISEASE PERIOD** - Black pod, frosty pod, and monilia thrive
- Harvest mature pods every 3-5 days minimum (reduces disease spread)
- Remove and bury/burn all diseased pods immediately (sanitation is primary control)
- Improve air circulation by pruning dense canopy areas
- Thin excessive shade if exceeding 70% (promotes air movement, reduces humidity)
- Apply copper-based fungicide if disease pressure is severe
- Monitor for pod borer entry holes
- Ensure good drainage around tree bases (no standing water)
  -Clear debris from ground to reduce disease inoculum

**September-November (Late Rainy/Transition to Dry)**:

- Continue frequent harvesting (still disease risk)
- Second major harvest period for many Costa Rican regions
- Repair or improve drainage systems before next rainy season
- Clean up fallen leaves and pod husks (disease control)
- Scout and remove witches' broom infections (prune 30cm below infection)
- Evaluate shade tree structure - plan January-February pruning
- Final organic fertilizer application if needed
- Consider trunk protection (copper paste) on susceptible varieties
- Prepare for reduced watering regime as dry season approaches

## Conservation Status

<Callout type="success" title="Least Concern">
  _Theobroma cacao_ is classified as **Least Concern (LC)** by the IUCN due to
  its extensive cultivation throughout the tropics. However, wild populations
  face significant threats, and the genetic diversity essential for the future
  of chocolate is at risk.
</Callout>

### Wild vs. Cultivated Populations

While cultivated cacao is widespread across tropical nations, truly wild _Theobroma cacao_ populations are increasingly rare. The species' center of origin in the upper Amazon basin faces ongoing deforestation, and many wild genetic lineages have never been collected or characterized.

### Threats to Cacao

1. **Genetic erosion**: Most commercial cacao derives from a very narrow genetic base. The loss of wild populations reduces the gene pool needed for disease resistance and climate adaptation.
2. **Climate change**: Rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns threaten cacao-growing regions. Models predict that many current growing areas will become unsuitable by 2050.
3. **Disease pressure**: Frosty pod rot, black pod, and witches' broom cause 30-40% annual crop losses globally. New strains continue to evolve.
4. **Deforestation**: Conversion of shade-grown cacao to full-sun monoculture or cattle pasture eliminates biodiversity benefits.
5. **Economic pressures**: Low commodity prices push farmers to abandon cacao for more profitable crops.

### Conservation Efforts

- **CATIE Gene Bank (Turrialba, Costa Rica)**: Maintains the world's largest living cacao collection with 1,100+ accessions from across the Americas. This is a critical global resource for cacao breeding and conservation.
- **In-situ conservation**: Programs to protect wild cacao populations in the Amazon basin.
- **Participatory plant breeding**: CATIE works with Costa Rican farmers to develop locally adapted, disease-resistant varieties.
- **Certification programs**: Rainforest Alliance, Organic, and Fair Trade certifications incentivize shade-grown, biodiversity-friendly cultivation.

## The Global Economics of Cacao

<Callout type="info" title="A $130 Billion Industry">
  The global chocolate market exceeds $130 billion annually, yet most cacao
  farmers earn less than $2 per day. This economic paradox drives much of the
  sustainability and social justice work in the cacao sector.
</Callout>

### Costa Rica's Chocolate Renaissance

Costa Rica was once a significant cacao producer, but the devastating arrival of _Moniliophthora roreri_ (frosty pod rot) in the 1970s-80s collapsed the industry. By the 1990s, most farmers had abandoned cacao for banana or cattle.

Since the 2010s, a remarkable recovery has occurred, driven by:

- **Specialty chocolate movement**: Costa Rican cacao now commands premium prices as "fine-flavor" cacao, recognized by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO)
- **Agritourism**: Chocolate farm tours generate income that often exceeds the value of the cacao itself
- **Organic and Fair Trade**: Costa Rica's strong environmental brand supports premium certifications
- **Indigenous empowerment**: Bribri communities leverage cultural heritage cacao as a source of economic independence
- **Bean-to-bar artisans**: Domestic chocolate makers like Sibu, Nahua, and Caribeans create world-class products from local beans

### Theobromine: The Chemistry of Chocolate

The characteristic effects of chocolate come from **theobromine** (3,7-dimethylxanthine), a bitter alkaloid unique to cacao:

- **Chemical class**: Methylxanthine (related to caffeine)
- **Concentration**: 1-2% in cocoa powder, 0.5-1% in dark chocolate
- **Human effects**: Mild stimulant, vasodilator, mood enhancer, cough suppressant
- **Pet toxicity**: Dogs metabolize theobromine 6-10× slower than humans, making even moderate amounts dangerous
- **Evolutionary role**: Likely evolved as an insect deterrent, but ceratopogonid midges are unaffected
- **Pharmacological interest**: Under study for cardiovascular benefits, cognitive enhancement, and anti-inflammatory properties

## Similar Species

Several related species in the genus _Theobroma_ and family Malvaceae may be confused with cacao:

### Theobroma bicolor (Pataste / Mocambo)

**Key differences**:

- Larger tree (8-15 m vs. 4-8 m for cacao)
- Pods are rounder, with a hard woody shell and prominent ridges
- Seeds produce "white chocolate" (pataste butter)
- More cold-tolerant than cacao
- Grown in Costa Rica primarily in indigenous gardens
- Pods do not change color when ripe (remain green)

### Theobroma angustifolium (Cacao de Mono)

**Key differences**:

- Wild understory tree of Central American rainforests
- Smaller pods (8-12 cm) with thinner shell
- Seeds are smaller and less flavorful than _T. cacao_
- Not commercially cultivated
- Found in Costa Rica's Caribbean and southern Pacific forests

### Herrania purpurea (Cacao de Montaña)

**Key differences**:

- Striking purple-red cauliflorous flowers (much larger and showier than cacao)
- Pods smaller, ribbed, covered in dense brown hairs
- Forest understory shrub/small tree
- Seeds edible but not commercially valuable
- Found in primary rainforest—indicator of undisturbed habitat

### Cupuaçu (Theobroma grandiflorum)

**Key differences**:

- South American species, not native to Costa Rica
- Much larger, oblong pods (20-25 cm) with thick brown-fuzzy shell
- Pulp (not seeds) is the primary product—used for juice, ice cream, cosmetics
- Occasionally planted in Costa Rican botanical gardens

## Identification Guide

### Field Identification Key

1. **Habitat**: Shaded understory in tropical lowland wet forest (0-800 m) → consistent with cacao
2. **Size**: Small tree, 4-8 m tall → narrows candidates
3. **Cauliflory**: Flowers and fruits emerge directly from trunk and main branches → diagnostic
4. **Pods**: Large (15-35 cm), colorful, oblong pods on trunk → confirms _Theobroma cacao_
5. **Leaves**: Simple, large (20-40 cm), alternate, pendulous when young → consistent
6. **New leaf color**: Bronze to reddish flush → characteristic

### Seasonal Identification

- **Year-round**: Flowers present on trunk (cauliflory); small white/pink, 1-2 cm
- **Year-round**: Pods at various stages—green immature pods alongside ripe yellow/orange/red pods
- **Peak fruiting**: In Costa Rica, two main harvest peaks: **November-January** (main crop) and **May-July** (mid-crop)
- **New leaf flush**: Bright bronze-red new leaves appear periodically, especially after dry spells

### Distinguishing from Other Cauliflorous Trees

Cauliflory (flowering directly from the trunk) is unusual but not unique to cacao. In Costa Rica, distinguish from:

- **_Crescentia cujete_** (Jícaro): Larger tree, round hard-shelled gourds, different leaves
- **_Parmentiera valerii_** (Candelillo): Narrow bean-like fruits, compound leaves
- **_Theobroma bicolor_** (Pataste): See Similar Species above

## Interesting Facts

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="🪰 Tiny Essential Pollinators">

Cacao flowers are pollinated almost exclusively by tiny midges (Forcipomyia and
related genera) barely 1-3mm long. These insects breed in rotting leaf litter
on the forest floor. Without them, no chocolate! Maintaining leaf litter and
shade in cacao farms is essential for pollinator populations.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="💰 Ancient Currency">

Cacao beans were so valuable to the Aztecs that they were used as currency.
Records show prices like: 1 turkey = 100 beans, 1 avocado = 3 beans, 1 tamale
= 1 bean. Counterfeiting was a problem—some traders filled bean shells with
mud to pass them off as real currency!

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🧬 Genetic Diversity Center">

Recent genetic research suggests the Amazon basin, not Central America, is
cacao's original home. However, Central America—including Costa Rica—is where
it was first domesticated and where unique genetic varieties developed over
thousands of years of cultivation.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🍫 From Bitter to Sweet">

Ancient Mesoamerican chocolate was nothing like modern candy bars. It was a
bitter, spicy beverage mixed with chili peppers, vanilla, and sometimes corn.
Adding sugar to chocolate only happened after Europeans brought it back to
Spain and combined it with cane sugar—itself a relatively new crop in Europe.
