<AccordionItem title="🔬 Taxonomic Notes">

The genus _Piper_ is enormous—with over 1,000 species making it one of the largest plant genera. It includes black pepper (_P. nigrum_), betel leaf (_P. betle_), and kava (_P. methysticum_). The species name _auritum_ means "eared" in Latin, referring to the ear-like lobes at the leaf base.

**Aromatic Compounds**: The distinctive anise-like aroma comes primarily from safrole and other phenylpropanoids. This compound profile is shared with sassafras, explaining why Hoja Santa is sometimes called "root beer plant."

**Culinary Importance**: Hoja Santa is one of the most important culinary herbs in traditional Mexican cuisine, used since pre-Columbian times.
