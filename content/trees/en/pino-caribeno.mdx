# Safety Information

toxicParts: []
skinContactRisk: "low"
allergenRisk: "moderate"
structuralRisks:
  - "falling-branches"
  - "heavy-fruit"
childSafe: true
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "Caribbean Pine is non-toxic. No parts of the tree pose ingestion risks to humans or animals. Pine resin may cause mild gastrointestinal discomfort if consumed in large quantities, but this is not a realistic exposure scenario. The tree is safe for parks, schools, and residential areas."
skinContactDetails: "Pine resin (pitch) can adhere to skin and clothing but is not a chemical irritant. Removal with oil-based solvents is straightforward. Needle litter is sharp underfoot but does not cause chemical dermatitis. Sawdust may cause mechanical irritation during prolonged milling."
allergenDetails: "Pine pollen is produced in large quantities and is wind-dispersed, making it a moderate allergen for sensitive individuals during the brief pollination season. Pollen appears as yellow dust on surfaces. Pine wood dust is a recognized respiratory irritant in occupational settings."
structuralRiskDetails: "Mature trees can shed heavy branches, especially after storms or during drought stress. Falling pine cones are dense and can cause minor injury. Trees planted too close to structures may develop root conflicts. In lightning-prone areas, tall isolated pines attract strikes."
safetyNotes: "Caribbean Pine is one of the safest plantation trees for public spaces. No toxicity, no spines, no caustic sap. Main considerations are pollen allergy management and structural branch safety in aging stands near paths or buildings."
wildlifeRisks: "Very low. Pine plantations provide some habitat for raptors, woodpeckers, and generalist species. Dense monoculture stands support fewer wildlife species than native forest; mixed plantings improve habitat quality."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "fast"
growthRateDetails: "Fast; 1.5-2.5 m per year in favorable lowland conditions. Among the fastest tropical pines."
matureSize: "20-35 m tall, crown spread 6-12 m"
hardiness: "Tropical lowlands and mid-elevations; tolerates seasonal drought; sensitive to hard frost"
soilRequirements: "Adaptable; grows well on acidic, infertile, and sandy soils. Tolerates laterites and degraded substrates. Prefers well-drained conditions; avoid permanent waterlogging."
waterNeeds: "moderate"
waterDetails: "Moderate. Tolerates seasonal drought once established. Best growth with 1200-2500 mm annual rainfall. Supplemental watering benefits young trees in their first dry season."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plant 3x3 m for timber plantations; 6-10 m in mixed systems; 12-15 m for specimen trees"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
  - "seedlings"
propagationDifficulty: "easy"
plantingSeason: "Rainy season onset (May-July) for bare-root stock; container seedlings flexible through rainy season"
maintenanceNeeds: "Low to moderate. Prune lower branches for clear bole in timber plantations. Thin at 4-6 years. Manage fire risk in dry season — needles create flammable litter layer. Monitor for pine bark beetles in stressed or drought-weakened stands."
commonProblems:
  - "Pine bark beetle infestations in stressed trees"
  - "Needle blight in continuously wet environments"
  - "Fire risk from accumulated needle litter"
  - "Wind damage in exposed sites"
  - "Poor growth on waterlogged or calcareous soils"

# Caribbean Pine (Pino Caribeño)

<Callout type="tip" title="The Tropical World's Pine">
  **Caribbean Pine** (_Pinus caribaea_), known in Costa Rica as **Pino
  Caribeño**, is a remarkable tropical conifer — one of the few pine species
  that thrives in hot, humid lowlands. Native to Central America and the
  Caribbean, it has been planted across the tropics for timber, resin, and
  watershed protection. Its distinctive silhouette and aromatic pine scent bring
  a temperate character to tropical landscapes.

### Global Context

Caribbean Pine occurs naturally from the Bahamas and Cuba through Belize,
Guatemala, Honduras, and northeastern Nicaragua. It has been planted as a
plantation species across the tropics — including Brazil, Australia, India,
Southeast Asia, and West Africa — making it one of the most widely cultivated
tropical pine species in the world.

### Distribution in Costa Rica

In Costa Rica, Caribbean Pine appears primarily as planted stock:

- **Central Valley regions** (reforestation programs and ornamental plantings)
- **Mid-elevation slopes** (watershed protection plantings around reservoirs)
- **Northern Zone** (forestry trials and mixed plantation systems)
- **Pacific slopes** (experimental plots at forestry stations)
- **Urban parks and campuses** (shade and landscape specimens)

Caribbean Pine does not occur naturally in Costa Rica. All populations are
planted or naturalized from forestry stock.

### Naturalization Status

<Callout type="info" title="Limited naturalization in Costa Rica">
  Unlike in some Pacific island nations, Caribbean Pine has not become
  significantly invasive in Costa Rica. The species does produce volunteer
  seedlings in open, fire-prone areas near plantations, but spread has been
  limited. Monitoring is still advisable near native oak and cloud forest
  ecosystems.

    ["Light", "Full sun", "Shade-intolerant; open-canopy pioneer"],

/>

### Fire Ecology

Caribbean Pine is one of the few tropical trees adapted to periodic fire.
Unlike most tropical species, it has evolved thick bark, self-pruning branches,
and elevated crown placement that allow it to survive ground fires.

<DataTable
  headers={["Fire adaptation", "Function", "Management implication"]}

/>

<Callout type="warning" title="Fire management critical">
  Pine needle litter is highly flammable. In Costa Rica's dry season, unmanaged
  pine plantations pose fire risk to adjacent native forests. Regular prescribed
  burning or litter management is essential, especially in Guanacaste and dry
  Pacific sites.

<AccordionItem title="Bark">
  Bark is thick, rough, and deeply furrowed on mature trees, forming rectangular

  <AccordionItem title="Needles">
    Leaves are long, flexible needles borne in fascicles (bundles), a

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Resin System">
    The tree produces copious oleoresin through a network of resin ducts in
    wood and bark. Resin flows freely when bark is wounded, providing defense
    against bark beetles and other pests.

    <Callout type="info">
      Pine resin has been commercially tapped in plantation settings, yielding
      turpentine (volatile fraction) and rosin (non-volatile fraction). While
      not a major industry in Costa Rica, small-scale resin harvesting occurs
      in some older plantations.

## Cultural & Economic Significance

### Pine in Central American Culture

Pine forests are a defining landscape of the Miskito Coast of Honduras and
Nicaragua and the Pine Barrens of the Bahamas. In these regions, Caribbean
Pine has deep cultural associations with fire ecology, traditional resin
harvesting, and community forestry.

### Economic Context in Costa Rica

<DataTable

  rows={[
    ["Rotation period", "15-25 years for structural timber; 8-12 for pulp"],

    [
      "Investment profile",
      "Moderate returns; long rotation vs. broadleaf species",
    ],
  ]}
/>

### Historical Context

<Callout type="info" title="Costa Rica's reforestation history">
  Caribbean Pine was introduced to Costa Rica in the 1970s-1980s as part of
  national reforestation programs. It was valued for its tolerance of poor soils
  and fast growth. Over time, policy has shifted toward native species for
  reforestation, but existing pine plantations remain in production and some new
  planting continues for specific objectives.

<Callout type="success" title="A Tropical Conifer with Purpose">
  Caribbean Pine fills a unique niche in Costa Rica's planted landscape —
  providing timber, watershed protection, and amenity value on difficult sites
  where many broadleaf species struggle. When managed with fire awareness,
  native species integration, and ecological monitoring, it contributes
  meaningfully to productive and protective land uses across tropical
  elevations.
