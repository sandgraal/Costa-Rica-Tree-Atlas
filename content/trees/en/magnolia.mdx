# Magnolia (Candelilla)

<Callout type="info" title="Living Fossil of the Cloud Forest">
  The **Magnolia poasana**, known locally as Candelilla, is one of Costa Rica's
  most beautiful highland trees. Named after **Poás Volcano**, this species
  belongs to one of the most ancient flowering plant families on Earth.
  Magnolias appeared over 95 million years ago, before bees evolved, and were
  pollinated by beetles. Today, this **Near Threatened** species is restricted
  to the cloud forests of Costa Rica's volcanic ranges, a living link to the
  deep past.

## An Ancient Lineage

### Magnolias: Among the First Flowers

<Callout type="tip" title="95 Million Years of History">
  Magnolias are among the most **primitive flowering plants** still alive today:

- **Origin**: Appeared in the Early Cretaceous (95+ million years ago)
- **Dinosaur contemporaries**: Flourished when dinosaurs roamed
- **Pre-bee pollination**: Evolved before bees—pollinated by beetles
- **Primitive features**: Spiral flower parts, undifferentiated tepals
- **Living fossils**: Little changed over tens of millions of years

When you see a magnolia flower, you're looking at a design that predates
most modern flower forms.

</Callout>

### Why Costa Rica Has Magnolias

Magnolias today are found mainly in East Asia and the Americas—a distribution pattern called "disjunct." This reflects their ancient origins when continents were differently arranged. Costa Rica's magnolias, including _M. poasana_, represent the Central American branch of this ancient lineage.

## Conservation Status

### IUCN Assessment

<ConservationStatusBox
  status="NT"
  criteria="Near Threatened"
  assessmentYear={2014}
/>

### Why Near Threatened?

<Callout type="warning" title="Pressures on Cloud Forest">
  _Magnolia poasana_ faces several threats:

- **Habitat loss**: Cloud forests cleared for agriculture, pasture
- **Climate change**: Cloud base rising, drying forests
- **Fragmentation**: Isolated populations
- **Limited range**: Restricted to specific elevational band
- **Slow reproduction**: Long generation time

While not immediately endangered, the combination of specialized habitat
requirements and ongoing threats justifies the Near Threatened status.

</Callout>

### Climate Change Vulnerability

<Callout type="error" title="The Migrating Cloud">
  Cloud forest species like _Magnolia poasana_ face a unique threat from climate
  change:

- As temperatures rise, the cloud layer moves upslope
- Trees cannot migrate fast enough to follow
- Species at mountaintops have nowhere to go
- Forecast models predict significant habitat loss

Costa Rica's cloud forests are considered among the most climate-vulnerable
ecosystems in the country.

## Ecological Relationships

### Pollination: The Beetle Connection

<Callout type="info" title="Ancient Pollination Partnership">
  Unlike most modern flowers, magnolias evolved with **beetle pollinators**:

- Beetles are among the oldest insects
- Thick tepals resist beetle damage
- Strong scent attracts beetles
- Flowers provide beetle food and shelter
- Relationship predates bees by millions of years

This ancient partnership continues in Costa Rica's cloud forests today.

<Callout type="success" title="Guardians of Deep Time">
  The Magnolia poasana is more than a beautiful tree—it's a messenger from deep
  time, a survivor of epochs that saw dinosaurs rise and fall. Its flowers,
  opening in the mist of Costa Rica's cloud forests, are essentially unchanged
  from those that bloomed 95 million years ago. Protecting this species means
  preserving not just a tree, but an irreplaceable link to Earth's botanical
  heritage. In its waxy white petals and beetle-attracting fragrance, we see the
  very origins of flowering plants.
