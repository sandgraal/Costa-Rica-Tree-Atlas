# Cativo (The Swamp Forest Giant)

<Callout type="warning" title="Protected Species in Costa Rica">
  The **Cativo** (_Prioria copaifera_) is a majestic tree of coastal swamp
  forests, legally protected as a **threatened species under Costa Rican law**.
  While globally assessed as Least Concern by IUCN, Costa Rica recognizes the
  vulnerability of its populations in the unique mangrove-adjacent ecosystems of
  the Caribbean and Pacific coasts. This tree's specialized habitat—flooded
  forests near the sea—is itself threatened, making the Cativo a symbol of
  coastal wetland conservation.

## The Tree Between Worlds

### A Specialist of Transitional Zones

The Cativo occupies one of the most challenging and specialized habitats in the neotropics: the flooded forests where freshwater rivers meet tidal influence, adjacent to mangroves but not quite mangroves themselves. These "cativales" (Cativo forests) represent a unique ecosystem type.

<Callout type="info" title="What Are Cativales?">
  **Cativo forests (cativales)** are a distinct forest type characterized by:

- **Dominance**: Cativo often forms nearly pure stands
- **Flooding**: Regular freshwater inundation
- **Tidal influence**: Near estuaries and coastal zones
- **Height**: Canopy reaching 40-50 m
- **Composition**: Few other species tolerate these conditions

These forests are found from Nicaragua to Colombia but are especially notable
in Costa Rica and Panama.

<Callout type="info" title="A Unique Legume">
  Despite being in the legume family (Fabaceae), Cativo belongs to an unusual
  subfamily (Detarioideae) that doesn't form the typical nitrogen-fixing root
  nodules. Instead, these trees have evolved to thrive in nutrient-rich
  waterlogged soils. The genus _Prioria_ contains only a few species, all
  restricted to Central and South American swamp forests.

## Physical Description

### Overall Form

The Cativo is a towering tree with a straight, cylindrical trunk that rises like a column from the swampy forest floor. Its buttresses, while present, are typically smaller than many other large rainforest trees.

  <StatBar label="Mature Height" value={45} max={55} unit="meters" />
  <StatBar label="Trunk Diameter" value={150} max={200} unit="cm" />
  <StatBar label="Clear Bole" value={25} max={35} unit="meters" />
  <StatBar label="Buttress Height" value={2} max={4} unit="meters" />
</StatsGroup>

### Distinctive Features

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Trunk & Bark

- **Trunk**: Remarkably straight and cylindrical
- **Bark**: Gray to brown, slightly rough
- **Buttresses**: Present but moderate
- **Resin**: Black, fragrant resin from heartwood
- **Wood**: Lightweight for its size

</Column>
<Column>

#### Leaves & Crown

- **Leaves**: Compound, alternate, 4-8 leaflets
- **Leaflets**: 8-15 cm, leathery, glossy
- **Crown**: Large, spreading, rounded
- **Canopy position**: Emergent to upper canopy
- **Evergreen**: Retains leaves year-round

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

### The Black Resin

<Callout type="tip" title="Cativo's Secret: Black Resin">
  One of Cativo's most distinctive features is the **black, oily resin** that
  oozes from wounds in the heartwood. This resin:

- Has a distinctive, pleasant fragrance
- Was traditionally used in medicine
- Creates dark streaks in the wood
- Contributes to heartwood durability
- Makes the wood somewhat resistant to rot

This resin is related to copaiba oil, hence the species name _copaifera_.

## Habitat & Distribution

### Geographic Range

Cativo is found along the Caribbean and Pacific coasts from Nicaragua through Costa Rica and Panama to northern Colombia, always in low-lying, frequently flooded forests.

<DataTable
  headers={["Country", "Region", "Notes"]}
  rows={[
    ["Costa Rica", "Caribbean coast (Limón)", "Protected populations"],
    ["Costa Rica", "Pacific coast (Puntarenas)", "Scattered stands"],
    ["Panama", "Darién region", "Largest remaining forests"],
    ["Colombia", "Chocó region", "Southern populations"],
    ["Nicaragua", "Caribbean lowlands", "Northern limit"],
  ]}
/>

### The Cativo Forest Ecosystem

<Callout type="info" title="Cativales: A Unique Forest Type">
  **Characteristics of Cativo forests:**

- **Location**: River deltas, estuaries, tidal flats
- **Flooding**: Regular freshwater inundation
- **Salinity**: Tolerate some brackish influence
- **Soil**: Waterlogged, organic-rich
- **Diversity**: Relatively low tree diversity (Cativo dominant)
- **Understory**: Sparse due to flooding
- **Wildlife**: Unique community adapted to flooding

These forests exist in a narrow zone—too wet and flooded for typical
rainforest, but too far inland for true mangroves.

## Conservation Status

### A Tale of Two Assessments

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Global (IUCN)

- **Status**: Least Concern
- **Reasoning**: Large overall range
- **Population**: Considered stable globally
- **Trend**: Some decline noted

</Column>
<Column>

#### Costa Rica

- **Status**: Threatened (Protected by law)
- **Reasoning**: Limited habitat, local declines
- **Protection**: Harvesting regulated
- **Concern**: Specialized habitat vulnerable

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

<Callout type="warning" title="Why Local Protection Matters">
  Costa Rica's decision to protect Cativo reflects a key conservation principle:
  a species can be globally stable while being locally threatened. The
  specialized swamp-forest habitat in Costa Rica is limited and vulnerable,
  justifying stronger protections than the global assessment might suggest.
</Callout>

### Threats

<DataTable
  headers={["Threat", "Severity", "Notes"]}
  rows={[
    ["Coastal development", "High", "Ports, tourism infrastructure"],
    ["Drainage projects", "High", "Wetland conversion for agriculture"],
    ["Timber extraction", "Moderate", "Historical logging, now regulated"],
    ["Climate change", "Uncertain", "Sea level rise may affect tidal forests"],
    ["Pollution", "Moderate", "Agrochemical runoff"],

## Timber & Traditional Uses

### Wood Properties

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Characteristics

- **Weight**: Moderately light (0.45-0.55 g/cm³)
- **Color**: Pale yellowish, darkening with age
- **Grain**: Straight to interlocked
- **Workability**: Easy to work
- **Durability**: Moderate (resin helps)

</Column>
<Column>

#### Uses

- **Plywood**: Excellent for veneers
- **Furniture**: Cabinet making
- **Light construction**: Interior use
- **Boats**: Traditional canoe making
- **Boxes**: Packing, containers

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

<Callout type="info" title="Historical Importance">
  In the mid-20th century, Cativo was heavily logged in Panama and Costa Rica
  for plywood production. The straight trunks and large size made it ideal for
  peeling into veneers. This exploitation, combined with the limited extent of
  cativo forests, led to significant declines and eventual protection.
</Callout>

### Traditional Medicine

The black resin and other parts were used in traditional medicine:

- **Resin**: Wound healing, antiseptic
- **Bark decoctions**: Fever, digestive ailments
- **Related to copaiba**: Similar resin properties

## Playa Cativo: A Living Legacy

<Callout type="tip" title="Named for the Tree">
  **Playa Cativo** is an eco-lodge on the Golfo Dulce in Costa Rica, named after
  the Cativo trees that grow in the coastal forests of the region. This
  connection between place and tree exemplifies how conservation and tourism can
  work together—the tree becomes a symbol of the region's natural heritage, and
  protecting the tree protects the destination's appeal.

<Callout type="success" title="Guardian of the Coastal Forests">
  The Cativo stands as a sentinel between land and sea, a living bridge between
  terrestrial and aquatic worlds. Its protection in Costa Rica reflects an
  understanding that some species matter more locally than global assessments
  might suggest—and that the unique ecosystems they create are worth saving.
  When we protect the Cativo, we protect the flooded forests, the coastal
  wetlands, and all the life that depends on this remarkable tree that thrives
  where few others can.
