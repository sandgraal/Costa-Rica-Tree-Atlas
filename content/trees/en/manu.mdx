# Manú (Black Manwood)

<Callout type="warning" title="Threatened Rainforest Giant">
  The **Manú** (_Minquartia guianensis_) is one of the most valuable and
  increasingly rare hardwood trees in Costa Rica's lowland rainforests. Its
  incredibly dense, rot-resistant wood has been prized for centuries, leading to
  severe overexploitation. Today, large Manú trees are a rare sight, and the
  species is considered vulnerable throughout its range.

## Physical Description

### Overall Form

The Manú is a large, emergent rainforest tree that towers above the canopy. It develops a straight, cylindrical trunk with large buttress roots at the base. The crown is relatively small and rounded compared to the massive trunk. Old-growth specimens are becoming increasingly rare due to their timber value.

## The Legendary Timber

### Exceptional Wood Properties

<Callout type="success" title="Nature's Ironwood">
  Manú wood is among the densest and most durable in the Neotropics. With a
  specific gravity exceeding 1.0 (it sinks in water!), this timber resists
  decay, insects, and mechanical damage for decades—even when in contact with
  soil or water.
</Callout>

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Wood Characteristics

- **Density**: 1.05-1.25 g/cm³
- **Hardness**: Extremely hard (6,000+ lbf Janka)
- **Color**: Dark brown to black heartwood
- **Grain**: Fine, interlocked
- **Durability**: Class 1 (50+ years in ground)
- **Workability**: Very difficult (dulls tools)

</Column>
<Column>

#### Traditional Uses

- House posts and beams
- Bridge construction
- Fence posts (last 40+ years)
- Tool handles and implements
- Canoe paddles (indigenous)
- Railway ties (historically)

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

## Conservation Status

### A Species in Decline

<Callout type="error" title="Vulnerable (IUCN)">
  Manú has been heavily logged throughout its range due to its exceptional
  timber value. Large, mature trees are now rare, and the species faces ongoing
  pressure from illegal logging even in protected areas. Recovery is slow due to
  the tree's extremely slow growth rate.
</Callout>

### Conservation Challenges

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Threats

- Selective logging (targets largest trees)
- Habitat loss from deforestation
- Illegal timber extraction
- Slow reproduction
- Climate change impacts

</Column>
<Column>

#### Protection Efforts

- Listed in national forestry regulations
- Protected in some national parks
- Sustainable harvest programs (limited)
- Reforestation trials underway
- Seed collection for conservation

</Column>

## Distribution in Costa Rica

<Callout type="info" title="Where to Find It">
  Manú occurs in Costa Rica's Caribbean lowland rainforests, primarily below 800
  meters elevation. The best chances to see large specimens are in
  well-protected reserves like La Selva and Tortuguero.

## Interesting Facts

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="⚓ It Sinks!">

Manú wood is so dense that it actually sinks in water—a property shared by
only a handful of woods worldwide. This incredible density comes from tightly
packed wood fibers and natural resins that make the timber virtually
impervious to decay, even when submerged.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🪓 The Axe-Breaker">

Manú is so hard that it has reportedly broken axes and dulled chainsaw blades.
Traditional woodworkers had to carefully manage their tools when working this
species, and even today, specialized techniques are required. The name
"Ironwood" is well-earned.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="⏳ Patience Required">

A Manú tree may take 200-300 years to reach harvestable size. This incredibly
slow growth is one reason the species is so vulnerable—once a large tree is
cut, it takes human lifetimes to replace. This makes sustainable management
extremely challenging.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🏛️ Standing for Centuries">

Traditional indigenous houses built with Manú posts have been documented still
standing after 100+ years. The wood's resistance to termites, rot, and fungal
decay in one of Earth's most challenging environments is remarkable—a natural
preservation technology developed over millennia.
