# Safety Information

skinContactRisk: "none"
allergenRisk: "low"
structuralRisks: []
childSafe: false
petSafe: false
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "The SEEDS of guanábana are TOXIC and should NEVER be consumed. Seeds contain annonacin and other acetogenins that are neurotoxic. Ingestion of seeds can cause nausea, vomiting, and neurological symptoms. The FRUIT PULP is SAFE and delicious when seeds are completely removed. The LEAVES are used in traditional medicine but contain the same neurotoxic compounds as seeds—excessive consumption of leaf tea has been linked to atypical Parkinsonism. Moderation is key with any herbal use. ROOTS also contain toxic compounds."
safetyNotes: "The fruit pulp is safe and nutritious when properly prepared. Always remove ALL seeds before eating or juicing. Do not give seeds to children or pets. Use leaf tea medicinally with caution and in moderation. Pregnant women should consult healthcare providers before consuming leaf preparations. The fruit itself poses no toxicity risk—only seeds, leaves, and roots require caution."
wildlifeRisks: "Seeds are toxic to most mammals including pets and livestock. Fruit pulp (seedless) is safe for many animals."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "moderate"
growthRateDetails: "2-3 ft/year; begins fruiting in 3-5 years from seed, grafted trees in 2-3 years"
matureSize: "5-10 m tall (small tree/large shrub), crown spread 4-6 m"
hardiness: "Lowland tropical; 0-1000m elevation; sensitive to frost, prefers warm humid climates"
soilRequirements: "Adaptable to various soils; prefers well-drained sandy-loam rich in organic matter; pH 5.5-6.5; tolerates poor soils"
waterNeeds: "moderate"
waterDetails: "Requires regular watering during establishment and fruiting. Water 2-3 times weekly in dry season. Reduce watering slightly during flowering to encourage fruit set. Tolerates brief dry periods once mature but fruits best with consistent moisture."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plant 4-6 m from buildings and other trees; relatively compact tree suitable for smaller yards"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
  - "grafting"
  - "cuttings"
propagationDifficulty: "easy"
plantingSeason: "Rainy season (May-November) best; can plant year-round with consistent watering"
maintenanceNeeds: "LOW to MODERATE maintenance, HIGH fruit reward. Years 1-2: water regularly, apply balanced fertilizer every 2-3 months, stake young tree if needed, protect from strong winds. Years 3-5 (first fruiting): fertilize 3-4 times yearly (increase potassium and phosphorus for fruiting), prune to maintain shape and remove crossing branches, hand-pollinate flowers if fruit set is poor (transfer pollen morning hours). Years 5+: minimal pruning needed (remove dead wood, thin crowded growth), continue fertilizing 2-3 times yearly, harvest fruit when skin turns slightly yellowish-green and spines soften. IMPORTANT: Fruit doesn't ripen well off tree—let mature on tree then harvest when slightly soft."
commonProblems:
  - "Fruit flies damage ripening fruit - use fruit fly traps and paper bags over developing fruit"
  - "Poor fruit set - hand-pollinate flowers with soft brush in morning (flowers only receptive 1-2 days)"
  - "Anthracnose and black canker in humid conditions - improve air circulation, avoid overhead watering"
  - "Scale insects on leaves and stems - control with horticultural oil spray"
  - "Fruit boring beetles - harvest fruit promptly when ripe, don't leave fallen fruit on ground"
  - "Difficult to judge ripeness - fruit is ready when skin color lightens slightly and yields to gentle pressure"

# Guanábana (Soursop)

<Callout type="success" title="The Queen of Tropical Fruits">
  The **Guanábana** (_Annona muricata_), known in English as Soursop, produces
  one of the most distinctive and beloved fruits in the tropical world. Its
  large, heart-shaped fruits covered in soft spines contain a creamy white pulp
  with an unforgettable flavor—a complex combination of strawberry, pineapple,
  and citrus with a delightfully tangy undertone. Native to the Caribbean and
  Central America, the guanábana has been cultivated since pre-Columbian times
  and remains one of the most sought-after tropical fruits. In Costa Rica, *jugo
  de guanábana* (soursop juice) is a refreshing staple, and the fruit's unique
  flavor makes it perfect for ice creams, smoothies, and traditional remedies.

## Cultivation

### Growing Guanábana

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Site Selection">
    **Ideal Conditions**:
    - Full sun to partial shade
    - Protected from strong winds
    - Well-drained, fertile soil
    - pH 5.5-6.5
    - Space 6-8 meters between trees

    **Considerations**:
    - Avoid frost-prone areas
    - Needs consistent moisture
    - Low elevation preferred
    - Good air circulation reduces disease

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Propagation">
    **From Seed** (most common):
    - Use fresh seeds (viability decreases quickly)
    - Remove seed coat or scarify
    - Plant 2-3 cm deep in moist medium
    - Germination in 2-4 weeks
    - Variable fruit quality

    **From Grafting** (recommended):
    - Ensures fruit quality
    - Earlier fruiting (2-3 years vs 4-5)
    - Use seedling rootstock
    - Cleft or veneer grafts work well

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Care and Maintenance">
    **Watering**: Regular during establishment, moderate once mature

    **Fertilization**: Balanced NPK every 3-4 months

    **Pruning**: Light pruning to maintain shape and remove dead wood

    **Pollination**: Hand pollination often increases yields

    **Pest management**: Monitor for fruit flies and mealybugs

    **Harvest**: Pick when slightly soft, allow to ripen off tree
