# Guaba Bejuco (Vine Guaba)

<Callout type="success" title="The Sprawling Sister of the Ice Cream Bean">
  **Guaba Bejuco** (_Inga vera_) is a smaller, more sprawling relative of the
  popular Ice Cream Bean (_Inga edulis_). True to its name—"bejuco" means "vine"
  in Spanish—this species grows with a distinctive vine-like habit, sending out
  long, flexible branches that create a wide, spreading canopy. Native to
  Central American and Amazonian rainforests, this unassuming tree provides the
  same sweet edible pods as its larger relatives while offering exceptional
  benefits for agroforestry: fast growth, aggressive nitrogen fixation, and
  adaptability to marginal soils. In rural Costa Rica, Guaba Bejuco is often
  planted as living fences or along property boundaries, where its sprawling
  growth and soil-enriching properties make it a practical workhorse of
  sustainable farming.

## Distinguishing Features from Other Inga Species

<Callout type="warning" title="How to Tell Guaba Bejuco Apart">
  The **Inga** genus contains over 300 species, many with similar
  characteristics. **Key differences for I. vera**: **Growth Habit**: - Much
  more **sprawling and vine-like** than I. edulis (common Guaba) - Lower, wider
  canopy with long flexible branches - Often leans or sprawls across other
  vegetation **Size**: - Smaller mature height (8-15m vs 20-30m for I. edulis) -
  Thinner trunk (rarely exceeds 20-30 cm diameter) **Pods**: - Slightly shorter
  and narrower than I. edulis - Pods more cylindrical, less twisted - Still
  contain sweet edible pulp **Leaves**: - Leaflets slightly smaller and narrower
  - More numerous leaflets per leaf (5-8 pairs) - Leaf rachis (central stem)
  often has narrow wings between leaflets
</Callout>

---

## Physical Description

### Tree Form

**General Habit**: Small to medium-sized tree with distinctive sprawling, semi-scandent (partially climbing) growth habit. Unlike the upright form of most Inga species, I. vera typically develops a low, wide-spreading crown with long, flexible branches that may lean on adjacent vegetation or spread across the ground if unsupported. The trunk is relatively thin and often multiple-stemmed or branched low to the ground.

**Size**: Typically 8-15 meters tall with crown spread of 6-10 meters. Individual branches can extend even further if given space or support.

**Crown**: Broad, irregular, and spreading; often wider than tall. The loose, open canopy allows significant light penetration, making it useful for intercropping.

### Bark and Trunk

**Bark**: Smooth to slightly fissured, gray-brown to olive-brown in color. Young branches are green, becoming gray-brown with age. Bark is thin and relatively smooth compared to larger tree species, with occasional vertical fissures on older trunks.

**Trunk**: Relatively slender, rarely exceeding 30 cm diameter. Often crooked or leaning, with low branching. Multi-stemmed growth is common, especially when pruned or damaged.

### Leaves

**Type**: Alternate, pinnately compound (feather-like arrangement)

**Leaflets**: Typically 4-8 pairs of leaflets per leaf, each leaflet 6-12 cm long by 3-5 cm wide. Leaflets are elliptic to oblong, with smooth margins and pointed tips. Upper surface is deep green and slightly glossy; lower surface is paler and may have fine hairs.

**Rachis**: The central leaf stem (rachis) between leaflets often has narrow, flat wings (very characteristic of many Inga species). A gland is present between each pair of leaflets—a key identifying feature of the genus.

**Arrangement**: Leaves are crowded near branch tips, creating dense foliage zones with open spaces between them.

### Flowers

**Appearance**: Typical Inga flowers—white to pale greenish, brush-like or pom-pom shaped due to numerous long stamens (50-100+ per flower). Individual flowers are 3-4 cm across.

**Arrangement**: Produced in dense clusters (spikes or heads) at leaf axils or branch tips.

**Timing**: Primary flowering February-May in Costa Rica, but sporadic flowering can occur throughout the year in suitable conditions.

**Pollinators**: Primarily pollinated by bees, hawkmoths, and bats attracted by the night-fragrant flowers and abundant nectar.

### Fruit

**Type**: Legume pod (typical of Fabaceae family), 10-20 cm long by 2-3 cm wide.

**Appearance**: Long, cylindrical to slightly flattened pods, green when immature, turning yellowish-brown at maturity. Surface may have faint longitudinal ridges. Pods do not split open on the tree like dry legume pods; instead, they remain fleshy and are manually opened to access the seeds.

**Seeds**: 4-10 seeds per pod, each surrounded by abundant white, fluffy, sweet pulp. The pulp is the edible part.

**Maturation**: Pods mature May-August, approximately 2-3 months after flowering.

## Ecology and Natural History

### Ecological Role

**Nitrogen Fixation**: Like all legumes, _Inga vera_ forms symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria in root nodules. These bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen (N₂) into ammonia (NH₃), which plants can use. This "fixed" nitrogen enriches the soil through:

- Decomposition of nitrogen-rich leaves (leaf litter)
- Live root turnover releasing nitrogen
- Nodule senescence and decomposition

**Estimated Nitrogen Input**: 50-100 kg N/ha/year in mature stands—equivalent to moderate fertilizer application but produced naturally and sustainably.

**Soil Improvement**: Beyond nitrogen, the abundant leaf litter improves soil structure, water retention, and organic matter content.

### Wildlife Associations

**Seed Dispersers**:

- Monkeys (especially howler monkeys and capuchins)
- Parrots and other large fruit-eating birds
- Bats (fruit-eating Artibeus species)

**Pollinators**:

- Honeybees and native stingless bees
- Hawkmoths (night pollination)
- Nectar-feeding bats

**Foliage Consumers**:

- Leaf-cutter ants occasionally harvest leaves
- Various caterpillars (supports butterfly diversity)
- Sloths occasionally feed on tender leaves

**Habitat Provider**: The spreading branches and dense foliage provide nesting sites for birds and shelter for arboreal reptiles and frogs.

### Forest Dynamics

**Successional Role**: Early to mid-successional species. Guaba Bejuco colonizes disturbed areas, forest edges, and gaps, where its fast growth and nitrogen-fixing ability help "prepare" the soil for later-successional species. It's shade-tolerant as a seedling but requires gaps or edges for vigorous growth.

**Light Niche**: Classified as a "light demander" or "pioneer-gap species"—not as strictly light-demanding as true pioneers (like Cecropia), but requiring moderate to high light for optimal growth.

---

## Uses and Applications

### Edible Fruit

**Pulp Consumption**: The white, fluffy pulp surrounding the seeds is sweet, mildly flavored, and consumed fresh. While not as large or abundant as _I. edulis_ pods, the flavor is similar—slightly sweet with a cotton-candy texture.

**Nutritional Content**: The pulp is primarily carbohydrates (natural sugars) with small amounts of protein, fiber, vitamins (especially C), and minerals. It's a quick energy source with minimal processing required.

**Harvest**: Pods are harvested by hand when mature (yellowish-brown, slightly soft to touch). They can be stored for a few days refrigerated, but are best consumed fresh.

### Agroforestry and Farming Applications

**Living Fences**: The sprawling, fast-growing habit makes I. vera ideal for living fences. When planted 2-3 meters apart and regularly pruned, it creates dense barriers for livestock control or property boundaries. Prunings add nitrogen-rich mulch.

**Shade Tree for Coffee and Cacao**: While less common than I. edulis for commercial operations, I. vera is used in small-scale agroforestry:

- Moderate shade (40-60% canopy cover)
- Nitrogen input reduces fertilizer needs
- Fast growth provides shade quickly
- Edible fruit provides supplementary income

**Alley Cropping**: Planted in rows with crops (beans, maize, vegetables) grown in the alleys between rows. Periodic pruning provides nitrogen-rich mulch while the trees fix nitrogen in place.

**Soil Restoration**: Planted on degraded pastures or eroded slopes to:

- Stabilize soil with spreading root system
- Add organic matter and nitrogen
- Create conditions for succession to more diverse forests

### Other Traditional Uses

**Firewood**: The wood burns well and is used locally for cooking fires, though the small trunk size limits large-scale firewood production.

**Medicinal Uses**: In some regions, bark or leaf preparations are used traditionally for treating minor wounds or as anti-inflammatory agents, though scientific validation is limited.

---

## Cultural and Historical Significance

### Indigenous and Traditional Use

Indigenous peoples throughout Central and South America have long utilized _Inga_ species, including I. vera:

- **Food Source**: The sweet pods provided portable, ready-to-eat nutrition, especially for children during forest travel or work.
- **Soil Knowledge**: Traditional farmers recognized Inga's ability to "fatten" the soil, using it in swidden agriculture to restore soil fertility during fallow periods.

### Rural Costa Rica

In rural Costa Rican communities, Guaba Bejuco holds practical value rather than deep cultural symbolism:

- **Farm Utility**: Valued as a multipurpose farm tree (food, shade, soil improvement, fencing)
- **Childhood Snack**: Children eat the pods fresh from the tree—a common rural memory
- **Farmer's Friend**: Recognized for low maintenance and automatic soil fertilization

While less celebrated than larger fruit trees or famous timber species, Guaba Bejuco is appreciated by those who know its practical benefits.

---

## Conservation Status

<ConservationStatusBox
  status="Least Concern"
  statusColor="green"
  population="Stable"
  trend="stable"
  lastAssessed="2023"
/>

**IUCN Red List**: Least Concern (LC)

**Population Trend**: Stable to increasing

**Threats**: None identified. Like most Inga species, I. vera is adaptable, fast-growing, and commonly cultivated. It thrives in human-modified landscapes and is not dependent on primary forests.

**Protection**: Not requiring special conservation action. However, maintaining genetic diversity and wild populations in protected forests is valuable for future research and crop improvement.

---

## Growing Guaba Bejuco

### Ideal Growing Conditions

**Climate**: Tropical to subtropical lowlands and foothills. Prefers:

- Warm temperatures year-round (20-30°C / 68-86°F)
- High humidity
- Consistent rainfall or irrigation
- Protection from frost

**Soil**: Highly adaptable—one of Guaba Bejuco's best qualities:

- Tolerates poor, depleted soils (fixes its own nitrogen)
- Prefers well-drained soils but tolerates temporary waterlogging
- pH range 5.0-7.0 (acidic to neutral)
- Sand, loam, or clay—grows in all types

**Light**: Requires full sun to light shade. Young seedlings tolerate shade but grow much faster with direct light.

### Propagation

**From Seed** (Easiest method):

1. **Seed Collection**: Collect mature pods (yellowish, slightly soft). Extract seeds from pulp and plant immediately—Inga seeds lose viability quickly (within days to weeks).
2. **Germination**: Plant fresh seeds 1-2 cm deep in moist soil or potting mix. Germination occurs in 1-2 weeks.
3. **Seedling Care**: Keep soil moist. Provide light shade for the first few weeks, then transition to full sun.
4. **Transplanting**: Transplant when seedlings are 30-50 cm tall (3-6 months).

**From Cuttings**:

- Semi-hardwood cuttings (15-20 cm) can be rooted with rooting hormone and bottom heat, though success rates are lower than seeds.

### Planting

**Timing**: Plant at the start of the rainy season (May-June in Costa Rica) to minimize irrigation needs.

**Spacing**:

- Living fences / hedges: 2-3 m apart
- Agroforestry rows: 4-6 m between trees
- Fruit production: 5-8 m spacing for full crown development

**Planting Steps**:

1. Dig hole twice the root ball width
2. Add compost or organic matter (optional—tree is not demanding)
3. Place seedling and backfill with soil
4. Water deeply after planting
5. Mulch around base to retain moisture

### Care and Maintenance

**Watering**: Water regularly during the first dry season after planting. Once established, supplemental watering may not be needed except during prolonged drought.

**Fertilization**: Generally unnecessary due to nitrogen-fixing ability. If growth is slow on extremely poor soil, a balanced organic fertilizer can be applied in the first year.

**Pruning**: Minimal pruning required unless training for specific purpose:

- **Living Fence**: Prune regularly to maintain dense growth and height
- **Agroforestry**: Remove lower branches to create shade canopy without interfering with crops
- **Fruit Production**: Prune to improve air circulation and fruit access

**Mulching**: Apply organic mulch (leaves, wood chips) around the base to retain moisture and suppress weeds.

### Fruiting and Harvest

**Time to First Fruit**: 2-3 years from seed; sometimes earlier from vigorous seedlings in ideal conditions.

**Fruiting Season**: Main season May-August in Costa Rica; some trees fruit sporadically throughout the year.

**Harvest Timing**: Pods ready when they turn yellowish and feel slightly soft. They do not fall off the tree when ripe—harvest by twisting or cutting from the branch.

**Yield**: Variable depending on tree size and conditions. A mature tree may produce 10-30 kg of pods per year.

### Common Problems

**Thriving Too Well**: The vigorous, sprawling growth can become unmanageable in small spaces. Regular pruning controls spread.

**Seed Unavailability**: Fresh seeds are required for propagation but are not commercially available. Must collect from local trees.

**Scale Insects**: Occasionally affected but rarely serious. Prune affected branches or apply horticultural oil if infestation is heavy.

## Advanced Care Guidance

### Site Design and Planting

- Plant at rainy-season onset with 7-9 m spacing in mixed orchards, cacao systems, or riparian agroforestry.
- Prefers deep, well-drained soils with high organic matter and regular moisture.
- Use wind-protected establishment zones for faster early canopy development.

### Watering Program

- **Establishment (0-8 months):** Deep irrigation 1-2 times weekly during dry gaps.
- **Juvenile phase (8-30 months):** Water every 7-10 days in dry season.
- **Mature trees:** Supplemental water during prolonged drought improves flowering and pod fill.

### Fertilization Schedule

- Because of nitrogen fixation, prioritize phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and organic matter over high N inputs.
- Apply balanced low-N blend at rainy-season start and a potassium support dose before flowering.
- Renew mulch annually to stabilize moisture and microbial activity.

### Pruning and Structure

- Formative pruning should establish a manageable scaffold height for harvest access.
- Thin dense interior growth each year to improve light, airflow, and pod quality.
- In cacao systems, prune strategically to maintain target shade percentages.

### Pest and Disease Management

- Monitor pod borers, scale insects, and anthracnose pressure in humid months.
- Remove fallen pods and diseased material promptly to interrupt pest cycles.
- Integrate biological controls and habitat strips for natural enemies.

### Companion Planting

- **Recommended companions:** Cacao, vanilla on support trees, coffee in humid mid-elevation systems, and pollinator hedges.
- **Soil role:** Improves nitrogen cycling and litter contribution in diversified food forests.
- **Avoid nearby:** Highly light-demanding monoculture crops that are incompatible with managed shade.

### Seasonal Care Calendar (Costa Rican Conditions)

- **Dry season (Dec-Apr):** Deep irrigation, canopy light management, and pod sanitation.
- **Early rains (May-Jul):** Fertilization, replanting, and disease-prevention setup.
- **Peak rains (Aug-Oct):** Intensive fungal scouting and drainage checks.
- **Transition (Nov):** Pruning adjustments and flowering preparation.

### Growth Timeline and Harvest Notes

- Productive pod set commonly begins around years 2-3 with strong management.
- Harvest pods at full size but before overripening to maintain sweetness and reduce insect damage.
- Annual structural pruning is essential to keep this vigorous species productive and accessible.
