# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "none"
toxicParts: []
skinContactRisk: "low"
allergenRisk: "low"
structuralRisks: []
childSafe: true
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "Ron Ron (Goncalo Alves) is NON-TOXIC. The living tree, bark, leaves, and fruit pose no toxicity hazard to humans or animals. Safe for planting in residential areas, parks, and gardens where children and pets are present. Despite being in the Anacardiaceae family (which includes poison ivy), Astronium graveolens does NOT produce the toxic urushiol oils found in poison ivy/oak relatives. No documented poisoning from ingestion or contact. Birds and wildlife consume the fruits safely. The tree is completely safe for children and pets."
skinContactDetails: "Direct contact with the living tree is safe. WOOD DUST may cause MILD skin irritation, rashes, or redness in sensitive individuals, especially during woodworking. Reactions are typically mild and uncommon. The tree's sap and bark do not have strong irritant properties. Overall skin contact risk is LOW - most people handle the tree and wood without issues. If irritation occurs, wash exposed skin with soap and water."
allergenDetails: "Ron Ron is a reported SENSITIZER in some individuals, meaning repeated exposure can lead to allergic reactions, but severity is MILD compared to many tropical hardwoods. SYMPTOMS: Eye irritation, sneezing, coughing, respiratory discomfort. Skin rashes possible with dust exposure. No unusual chemical hazards or strong odors. SAFETY LEVEL: Lower allergen risk than rosewoods, mahogany, or cedars - reactions are uncommon and typically mild when they occur. Standard woodworking precautions (dust mask, ventilation, gloves, eye protection) are sufficient for safe handling."
safetyNotes: "Ron Ron is a SAFE and VALUABLE hardwood for landscaping and woodworking with MINIMAL safety concerns. LIVING TREE: Completely safe for gardens, parks, and areas with children and pets. No toxicity despite being related to poison ivy - this species lacks the toxic oils. WOODWORKING: Use standard protective measures (dust mask, gloves, eye protection, ventilation) as with any hardwood. The dust is a mild sensitizer - reactions are uncommon and usually not severe. Most woodworkers handle it without problems. Clean up sawdust promptly to minimize exposure. If you have respiratory issues or allergies, exercise standard caution. WOOD PROPERTIES: Exceptionally durable, rot-resistant, stunning figured grain (tiger-striped or zebra pattern), rivaling rosewood in beauty. Used for premium furniture, flooring, cabinetry, tool handles. FINISHED PRODUCTS: Safe for homes and offices - no concerns for end users. Overall, Ron Ron is safer than many premium tropical hardwoods while offering comparable beauty and durability."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "slow"
growthRateDetails: "Slow growth; 0.4-0.6 m/year; takes 10-15 years to reach 10 m height; achieves timber size (20-25 m) in 40-60 years; slow but steady; long-lived (100+ years)"
matureSize: "25-35 m tall, trunk diameter 50-100 cm; spreading irregular crown 15-20 m wide; emergent canopy tree at maturity"
hardiness: "Tropical dry to moist forests; Costa Rica elevation 0-1200m; thrives in Pacific slope dry and transitional forests; tolerates heat to 40°C; requires dry season; no frost tolerance"
soilRequirements: "Very adaptable; prefers deep, well-drained soils; tolerates poor to moderately fertile soils; pH 5.5-7.5; grows on hillsides, valleys, and disturbed areas; does NOT tolerate waterlogged conditions"
waterNeeds: "low"
waterDetails: "LOW to MODERATE water needs - good drought tolerance once established. Young trees (years 1-3) need weekly watering during dry season. Mature trees are drought-tolerant and thrive with natural rainfall (1500-2500 mm annual). Prefers areas with 3-5 month dry season. Can withstand extended dry periods. Water only during establishment and extreme drought."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plant 10-12 m from buildings; 12-15 m spacing for timber production; needs space for large mature size"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
propagationDifficulty: "easy"
plantingSeason: "Plant at start of rainy season (May-June) for best establishment; seeds germinate readily in 2-4 weeks"
maintenanceNeeds: "LOW maintenance - excellent for reforestation and timber. Years 1-3: water weekly during dry season, weed control, protect from livestock. Years 4-10: minimal care, very self-sufficient, no fertilizer needed. Years 11-40: essentially maintenance-free, allow natural development, prune only if needed for timber form. Slow growth requires patience but eventual payoff is spectacular figured wood. Valuable for long-term timber investments and conservation plantings."
commonProblems:
  - "SLOW GROWTH - 40-60 years to timber size, requires patience"
  - "Wood dust is mild sensitizer - use dust mask when working wood"
  - "Valuable figured wood creates theft risk for mature trees"
  - "Young seedlings may be browsed by livestock - protect"
  - "Limited commercial availability of seeds/seedlings"
  - "Few pest/disease problems - resilient species"
  - "Irregular fruiting - seed availability varies"
  - "Not suitable for quick timber production"

# Ron Ron (Goncalo Alves)

<Callout type="tip" title="Costa Rica's Hidden Treasure">
  **Ron Ron** (_Astronium graveolens_), known internationally as Goncalo Alves
  or Tigerwood, is one of Central America's most beautiful and durable
  hardwoods. Its striking figured grain with irregular dark streaks resembles
  zebrawood or rosewood, while its exceptional hardness and rot-resistance make
  it prized for demanding applications. Unlike many valuable timber trees, it
  remains relatively abundant where protected.

  Ron Ron wood is among the **finest hardwoods in the Americas**. Its
  exceptional properties include: - **Hardness**: 1910 Janka (harder than most
  hardwoods) - **Durability**: Extremely rot and insect resistant - **Figure**:
  Dramatic dark streaking on red-brown background - **Workability**: Takes
  excellent polish despite hardness - **Stability**: Minimal movement after
  proper drying This combination makes it prized for flooring, furniture, turned
  objects, and exterior applications where durability is critical.

### Conservation Context

<Callout type="info" title="Dry Forest Conservation">
  While Ron Ron itself is not currently threatened, its **primary habitat**—
  tropical dry forest—is one of the most endangered ecosystems in Central
  America. Only about 1% of Costa Rica's original dry forest remains intact. Ron
  Ron conservation is therefore tied to broader dry forest protection efforts: -
  **Santa Rosa National Park**: Major protected population - **Guanacaste
  Conservation Area**: Ongoing restoration - **Private reserves**: Important
  refugia - **Reforestation**: Increasingly planted

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Time to See Ron Ron">
  Visit Costa Rica's dry forests (Guanacaste) during the **late dry season
  (March-May)** to witness the dramatic transformation when Ron Ron and other
  dry forest trees burst into new leaf growth after months of dormancy. Santa
  Rosa National Park is the best accessible location, with well-maintained
  trails through some of the last remaining tropical dry forest in Central
  America. The contrast between the bare dry season appearance and the lush wet
  season canopy makes multiple visits rewarding.
