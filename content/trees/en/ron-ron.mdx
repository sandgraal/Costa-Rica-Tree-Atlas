# Ron Ron (Goncalo Alves)

<Callout type="tip" title="Costa Rica's Hidden Treasure">
  **Ron Ron** (_Astronium graveolens_), known internationally as Goncalo Alves
  or Tigerwood, is one of Central America's most beautiful and durable
  hardwoods. Its striking figured grain with irregular dark streaks resembles
  zebrawood or rosewood, while its exceptional hardness and rot-resistance make
  it prized for demanding applications. Unlike many valuable timber trees, it
  remains relatively abundant where protected.

  Ron Ron belongs to the Anacardiaceae (cashew family), making it a relative of
  the Espavel (wild cashew), mango, and even poison ivy. Like many family
  members, its sap can cause skin irritation in sensitive individuals. The genus
  name _Astronium_ refers to the star-shaped arrangement of the fruit sepals.

<Callout type="tip" title="The Figured Wood">
  Ron Ron is famous for its **highly figured wood**—irregular dark streaks on a
  reddish-brown background that can resemble tiger stripes or zebrawood. This
  figuring is highly variable between trees and even within the same log, making
  each piece unique. The most dramatically figured specimens command premium
  prices in the specialty wood market.

## Cultural & Economic Importance

### Premium Hardwood

<FeatureBox title="World-Class Wood" icon="🪵">
  Ron Ron wood is among the **finest hardwoods in the Americas**. Its
  exceptional properties include: - **Hardness**: 1910 Janka (harder than most
  hardwoods) - **Durability**: Extremely rot and insect resistant - **Figure**:
  Dramatic dark streaking on red-brown background - **Workability**: Takes
  excellent polish despite hardness - **Stability**: Minimal movement after
  proper drying This combination makes it prized for flooring, furniture, turned
  objects, and exterior applications where durability is critical.

### Conservation Context

<Callout type="info" title="Dry Forest Conservation">
  While Ron Ron itself is not currently threatened, its **primary habitat**—
  tropical dry forest—is one of the most endangered ecosystems in Central
  America. Only about 1% of Costa Rica's original dry forest remains intact. Ron
  Ron conservation is therefore tied to broader dry forest protection efforts: -
  **Santa Rosa National Park**: Major protected population - **Guanacaste
  Conservation Area**: Ongoing restoration - **Private reserves**: Important
  refugia - **Reforestation**: Increasingly planted

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Time to See Ron Ron">
  Visit Costa Rica's dry forests (Guanacaste) during the **late dry season
  (March-May)** to witness the dramatic transformation when Ron Ron and other
  dry forest trees burst into new leaf growth after months of dormancy. Santa
  Rosa National Park is the best accessible location, with well-maintained
  trails through some of the last remaining tropical dry forest in Central
  America. The contrast between the bare dry season appearance and the lush wet
  season canopy makes multiple visits rewarding.
