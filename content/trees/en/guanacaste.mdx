<AccordionItem title="🔬 Taxonomic Notes">

The genus name _Enterolobium_ comes from the Greek _enteron_ (intestine) and _lobos_ (lobe), referring to the coiled, ear-shaped seed pods. The species epithet _cyclocarpum_ means "circular fruit."

**Etymology of "Guanacaste"**: Derived from the Nahuatl word _cuauhnacastli_, meaning "ear tree" — from _cuahuitl_ (tree) and _nacastli_ (ear).

**Synonyms**: _Mimosa cyclocarpa_, _Pithecellobium cyclocarpum_

## Cultural & Historical Significance

<Callout type="info" title="National Symbol of Costa Rica">

On **August 31, 1959**, the Guanacaste tree was officially declared Costa Rica's national tree during the centenary celebration of the Annexation of Guanacaste — the 1824 decision by the people of Guanacaste Province to join Costa Rica rather than Nicaragua.

The tree was chosen because it:
