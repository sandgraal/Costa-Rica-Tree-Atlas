# The Guanacaste Tree

The **Guanacaste** (_Enterolobium cyclocarpum_), also known as the Elephant Ear Tree or Devil's Ear, is the national tree of Costa Rica. This magnificent species was declared the national tree on August 31, 1959, symbolizing the country's commitment to environmental conservation and natural heritage.

## Description

The Guanacaste is a large deciduous tree that can reach heights of 25 to 35 meters (80 to 115 feet) with an equally impressive crown spread. Its most distinctive feature is its massive, umbrella-shaped canopy that can extend up to 40 meters in diameter, providing invaluable shade in the tropical heat.

### Key Features

- **Trunk**: Large, often buttressed at the base, with gray-brown bark
- **Leaves**: Bipinnate compound leaves, feathery in appearance
- **Flowers**: Small, white to cream-colored, fragrant blooms appearing in spherical clusters
- **Fruit**: Distinctive ear-shaped pods (hence the common names), dark brown when mature

## Ecological Importance

The Guanacaste tree plays a crucial role in Costa Rica's ecosystem:

1. **Wildlife Habitat**: The large crown provides nesting sites for numerous bird species
2. **Soil Enhancement**: As a legume, it fixes nitrogen in the soil
3. **Shade Provider**: Essential for pasture management and livestock welfare
4. **Seed Dispersal**: The pods are eaten by horses and cattle, aiding seed distribution

## Cultural Significance

The Guanacaste tree gives its name to the Guanacaste Province, the northwestern region of Costa Rica known for its dry tropical forest ecosystem. The tree represents:

- **Resilience**: Thriving in both dry and wet conditions
- **Generosity**: Providing shade, food, and shelter for countless species
- **National Pride**: A symbol of Costa Rican identity and natural heritage

## Conservation

While currently listed as "Least Concern" by the IUCN, the Guanacaste tree faces challenges from habitat loss and land-use changes. Conservation efforts focus on:

- Protecting mature specimens in agricultural landscapes
- Reforestation programs including Guanacaste in native species mixes
- Seed banking and nursery programs

## Where to See Them

Notable locations to observe Guanacaste trees in Costa Rica include:

- **Santa Rosa National Park**: Historic groves in the dry forest
- **Guanacaste National Park**: Protected areas with mature specimens
- **Throughout the Nicoya Peninsula**: Common in pastures and along roadsides
- **University campuses**: Many planted as shade trees
