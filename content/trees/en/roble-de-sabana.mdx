# Roble de Sabana

<Callout type="tip" title="The Pink Cloud Tree">
  **Roble de Sabana** (_Tabebuia rosea_), also known as Pink Poui or Pink
  Trumpet Tree, is arguably Costa Rica's most recognizable flowering tree. Each
  dry season, these trees shed their leaves and burst into spectacular displays
  of pink blossoms, creating the appearance of "pink clouds" scattered across
  pastures, roadsides, and urban landscapes throughout the country.

## Ecological Significance

### Pollinator Paradise

<Callout type="success" title="Nectar Bonanza">
  During the dry season when flowers are scarce, the abundant blooms of Roble de
  Sabana provide a **critical nectar and pollen source** for countless bees,
  butterflies, and hummingbirds. A single flowering tree can support thousands
  of pollinator visits daily.
</Callout>

### Wildlife Interactions

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Pollinators

- **Bees**: Native stingless bees, carpenter bees, honeybees
- **Hummingbirds**: Multiple species visit flowers
- **Butterflies**: Sulfurs and swallowtails attracted
- **Moths**: Nocturnal pollination documented
- **Bats**: Occasional visitors to flowers

</Column>
<Column>

#### Other Wildlife

- **Parakeets**: Feed on developing seeds
- **Squirrels**: Use branches for travel corridors
- **Epiphytes**: Branches host orchids, bromeliads
- **Iguanas**: Often seen basking on branches
- **Cavity Nesters**: Old trees provide nest sites

## Cultural & Economic Importance

### National Symbol

<FeatureBox title="National Tree of El Salvador" icon="🇸🇻">
  The Roble de Sabana (_Tabebuia rosea_) is the **national tree of El
  Salvador**, where it is known as **Maquilíshuat** (from Nahuatl). It
  symbolizes beauty and the renewal that comes with the rainy season. In Costa
  Rica, while not the national tree, it holds a similar place in the cultural
  landscape as the most visible herald of the dry season.

### Traditional Uses

  ]}
/>

### Success Story

<Callout type="success" title="Conservation Success">
  The Roble de Sabana represents a rare **conservation success story**. Unlike
  many native trees that have declined, this species has likely increased in
  abundance over the past century due to its popularity as an ornamental and
  shade tree. It readily regenerates in pastures and tolerates human activity,
  making it one of the few native trees that actually benefits from landscape
  modification.

## Cultivation & Propagation

### Growing Roble de Sabana

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Propagation Methods

**From Seeds (Primary Method)**

1. Collect seeds from mature pods (April-June)
2. Sow within 2-4 weeks (short viability)
3. Light soil coverage
4. Keep moist; germination in 10-15 days
5. Transplant at 30-50 cm height
6. Very high success rate (90%+)

**From Cuttings**

1. Semi-hardwood cuttings possible
2. Rooting hormone recommended
3. Less common than seed propagation

</Column>
<Column>

#### Growing Conditions

<SimpleList
  items={[
    "Sun: Full sun preferred",
    "Soil: Adaptable, well-drained best",
    "Water: Drought-tolerant when established",
    "Spacing: 10-15 m for full development",
    "First Bloom: 3-5 years from seed",
    "Maintenance: Very low",
  ]}
/>

#### Urban Planting Tips

- Avoid planting over sidewalks (petal drop)
- Allow space for spreading crown
- No pruning needed except to shape when young
- Excellent for large parking lots and boulevards
- Combine with Corteza Amarilla for color contrast

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Time to See Roble de Sabana">
  For the most spectacular displays, visit Costa Rica between **mid-February and
  mid-March**. The Central Valley and Guanacaste offer the best viewing, with
  trees blooming along nearly every road. The combination of pink Roble de
  Sabana and yellow Corteza Amarilla blooming together is one of the country's
  most beloved natural spectacles. Don't miss the carpet of pink petals beneath
  the trees!
