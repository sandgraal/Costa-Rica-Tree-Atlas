description: "The Madroño is one of the most spectacular flowering trees of Central America's dry forests. When this medium-sized tree blooms during the dry season, it covers itself so completely with small white flowers that the entire crown appears draped in snow—an astonishing sight in the tropical heat. Native from Mexico through Central America, the Madroño has been chosen as the national tree of Nicaragua. In Costa Rica's Guanacaste Province, the flowering Madroño transforms the dry forest landscape into something magical, while its extremely dense, hard wood has made it valuable for tool handles, construction, and traditional crafts."

# Madroño (Lemonwood)

<Callout type="success" title="The Snowy Crown of the Dry Forest">
  The **Madroño** (_Calycophyllum candidissimum_), known in English as Lemonwood
  or Degame, creates one of Central America's most breathtaking natural
  spectacles. During the dry season, when most trees stand bare or subdued, the
  Madroño explodes into bloom, covering itself so completely with tiny white
  flowers that the entire tree appears to be dusted with snow. This stunning
  display has earned it the affection of peoples throughout its range—Nicaragua
  has even chosen it as their national tree. In Costa Rica's Guanacaste region,
  the flowering Madroño is an unforgettable sight, standing bright white against
  the brown dry forest backdrop like a beacon of beauty.

## Physical Description

### General Form

The Madroño is a medium-sized tree with a rounded to irregular crown. Its smooth, grayish bark and relatively small leaves give way during flowering season to an explosion of white that completely transforms the tree's appearance.

## Identification Guide

### How to Identify Madroño

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Key Identification Features" defaultOpen={true}>
    **Primary Identifiers:**

    1. **Complete white flowering** (dry season)
    2. **Smooth grayish bark**
    3. **Opposite, leathery leaves**
    4. **Dry forest habitat**
    5. **Yellowish inner bark** (when scratched)

    **Supporting Features:**
    - Medium-sized tree
    - Rounded crown
    - Coffee family member
    - Guanacaste/dry forest region

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="When NOT in Flower">
    Without flowers, look for:

    <DataTable
      headers={["Feature", "Characteristic"]}
      rows={[
        ["Bark", "Smooth, grayish, may peel"],
        ["Leaves", "Opposite, elliptic, leathery"],
        ["Location", "Dry forest habitat"],
        ["Size", "Medium tree (15-25 m)"],
        ["Inner bark", "Yellow when scratched"],
      ]}
    />

    The smooth bark and opposite leathery leaves in dry forest habitat are good indicators even when not flowering.

<Callout type="success" title="White Fire in the Dry Forest">
  In the heart of the dry season, when Guanacaste's forests stand brown and
  dusty under the relentless sun, the Madroño catches fire— not with flame, but
  with flowers. Thousands upon thousands of tiny white blossoms open
  simultaneously, transforming each tree into a beacon of pure white against the
  parched landscape. It's a sight that stops travelers in their tracks, that
  draws photographers from around the world, that has earned this tree the honor
  of being Nicaragua's national symbol. The sweetness of the flowers fills the
  air as bees work frantically to gather the precious nectar, one of the only
  abundant food sources in this harsh season. This is the Madroño's genius—to
  bloom when no one else can, to offer abundance when all around is scarcity, to
  make beauty from adversity. Its wood is among the hardest and most durable in
  Central America, fitting for a tree that has learned to thrive where others
  merely survive. To see a Madroño in full bloom is to understand something
  profound about timing, about strategy, about the spectacular ways that nature
  has evolved to fill every niche and season.
