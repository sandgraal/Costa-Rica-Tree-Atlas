# Ciprecillo (Costa Rican Podocarp)

<Callout type="error" title="Critically Endangered - Costa Rica's Rarest Tree">
  The **Ciprecillo** (_Podocarpus costaricensis_) is not just endangered—it is
  **Critically Endangered** and endemic to Costa Rica, meaning it exists nowhere
  else on Earth. Known from only **four locations** in San José Province, this
  ancient conifer represents one of the most urgent conservation priorities in
  Central America. With fewer than an estimated 2,500 mature individuals
  remaining, every single tree matters for the survival of this species.

## Why This Tree Matters

### A Living Fossil on the Brink

The Ciprecillo belongs to the Podocarpaceae family, an ancient lineage of conifers that dominated the southern supercontinent of Gondwana over 200 million years ago. While most of its relatives are found in the Southern Hemisphere (Australia, New Zealand, South America), this Costa Rican species represents a rare northern outpost of this ancient family.

<Callout type="warning" title="The Rarity Crisis">
  **What does Critically Endangered mean?** The IUCN classifies a species as
  Critically Endangered when it faces an extremely high risk of extinction in
  the wild. For _Podocarpus costaricensis_, this assessment is based on:

- Extremely limited range (fewer than 10 km² total habitat)
- Known from only 4 locations
- Continuing habitat decline
- Estimated fewer than 2,500 mature individuals

</Callout>

### Discovered Late, Threatened Early

Remarkably, this species was only formally described in 1990 by David de Laubenfels, meaning it was recognized by science just as its habitat was disappearing. This pattern—species being discovered as they approach extinction—is tragically common in tropical forests.

## Taxonomy & Classification

<PropertiesGrid>
  <PropertyCard title="Kingdom" value="Plantae" />
  <PropertyCard title="Division" value="Pinophyta (Conifers)" />
  <PropertyCard title="Class" value="Pinopsida" />

  <PropertyCard title="Species" value="P. costaricensis" />
</PropertiesGrid>

<Callout type="info" title="The Podocarp Family">
  Podocarpaceae contains about 170 species of conifers, mostly in the Southern
  Hemisphere. Unlike typical conifers, podocarps produce fleshy, berry-like
  structures rather than woody cones—an adaptation thought to aid bird
  dispersal. Finding this family in Costa Rica is biogeographically significant,
  as it suggests ancient forest connections now severed.

## Physical Description

### Overall Form

The Ciprecillo is a medium to tall evergreen conifer with a straight trunk and pyramidal crown. Its needle-like leaves and fleshy fruit structures distinguish it from Costa Rica's flowering trees.

## Habitat & Distribution

### The Most Restricted Range

<Callout type="error" title="A Species on the Edge">
  _Podocarpus costaricensis_ has one of the most restricted ranges of any tree
  in Central America:

- **Total known locations**: 4
- **Province**: San José only
- **Elevation range**: 70-1,700 meters
- **Total habitat area**: Less than 10 km²

This extreme restriction means a single catastrophic event—fire, disease, or
development—could eliminate a significant portion of the species.

</Callout>

### Preferred Habitat

- **Forest type**: Wet premontane and montane forest
- **Canopy position**: Emergent to upper canopy
- **Soil**: Well-drained, often on slopes
- **Moisture**: High rainfall areas
- **Association**: Mixed with broadleaf species

## Why Endemic Species Matter

<Callout type="info" title="The Value of Uniqueness">
  When we lose an endemic species, we lose something that exists nowhere else—a
  unique outcome of millions of years of evolution. The Ciprecillo represents:

- **Evolutionary history**: Ancient Gondwanan lineage
- **Costa Rican heritage**: A species found only in this country
- **Scientific value**: Unique genetics and ecology
- **Ecosystem function**: Role in its forest community
- **Future potential**: Unknown medicinal or other values

Protecting the Ciprecillo is protecting something irreplaceable.

## The Story of Discovery

### A Species Found on the Brink

The scientific discovery of _Podocarpus costaricensis_ in 1990 by botanist David de Laubenfels highlights a sobering reality: many species are identified only as they approach extinction. By the time this tree was formally recognized, its habitat had already been severely fragmented.

<Callout type="tip" title="Race Against Time">
  The Ciprecillo reminds us that countless species may disappear before we even
  know they exist. Protecting forest habitat—even areas we haven't fully
  surveyed—is essential for preserving biodiversity we haven't yet discovered.

<Callout type="error" title="A Call to Action">
  The Ciprecillo stands as both a warning and a call to action. This critically
  endangered endemic exists only in Costa Rica, known from only four
  locations—perhaps fewer trees than people who will read this page. Its
  survival depends on immediate and sustained conservation action. Every forest
  fragment protected, every seedling cultivated, every awareness raised brings
  us closer to ensuring this ancient lineage survives for future generations to
  discover and appreciate.
