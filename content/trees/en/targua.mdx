# Targuá (Dragon's Blood Tree)

<Callout type="success" title="The Bleeding Tree">
  The **Targuá** (_Croton draco_) is famous for its bright red sap that flows
  like blood when the bark is cut. This dramatic "dragon's blood" has been used
  in traditional medicine throughout Central America for centuries, valued for
  wound healing and various medicinal properties. As a pioneer species, Targuá
  plays a vital role in forest regeneration.

## The Famous Red Sap

### Dragon's Blood Chemistry

<Callout type="warning" title="Medicinal Marvel">
  The red sap of Targuá contains a complex mixture of compounds including
  proanthocyanidins, diterpenes, and alkaloids. Scientific studies have
  confirmed antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and wound-healing properties,
  validating centuries of traditional use.
</Callout>

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Active Compounds

- **Taspine**: Wound healing alkaloid
- **Proanthocyanidins**: Antioxidants
- **Lignans**: Anti-inflammatory
- **Diterpenes**: Antimicrobial
- **Catechins**: Various properties

</Column>
<Column>

#### Traditional Uses

- Wound healing (direct application)
- Mouth sores and gum disease
- Stomach ulcers (internal)
- Skin infections
- Post-childbirth healing
- Insect bites

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

### How to Collect Sap

Traditional harvesting method:

1. Make a shallow cut in the bark (not too deep)
2. Red sap flows immediately
3. Collect in clean container
4. Allow tree to heal between harvests
5. Sustainable harvesting doesn't harm the tree

<Callout type="info">
  The sap coagulates quickly when exposed to air, forming a protective "scab"
  similar to how blood clots, adding to its wound-healing reputation.
</Callout>

## Ecological Importance

### Pioneer Species Role

<Callout type="success" title="Forest Recovery Champion">
  Targuá is one of the most important pioneer species in Costa Rican forest
  recovery. It rapidly colonizes disturbed areas, providing shade and soil
  improvement that allows shade-tolerant species to establish underneath.
</Callout>

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Succession Services

- First to colonize clearings
- Creates shade for other species
- Adds organic matter to soil
- Attracts seed-dispersing birds
- Short lifespan allows replacement

</Column>
<Column>

#### Wildlife Value

- Seeds eaten by birds
- Flowers attract insects
- Leaves host caterpillars
- Structure for nesting
- Corridor species in landscapes

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

## Distribution in Costa Rica

<Callout type="info" title="Where to Find It">
  Targuá is found throughout Costa Rica's wet and moist forests, from lowlands
  to mid-elevations. It's especially common along roadsides, forest edges, and
  in recovering agricultural land.

## Interesting Facts

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="🩸 Blood Mimic">

The red sap of Targuá not only looks like blood but also acts like it in some
ways. When exposed to air, it quickly coagulates and forms a protective barrier,
similar to how blood clots. This natural "bandage" effect is one reason it's so
effective for wound healing—it literally seals cuts while delivering beneficial
compounds.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🌿 Living Pharmacy">

Indigenous peoples throughout Central and South America have used dragon's blood
trees as living pharmacies for millennia. The sap was so valued that during
colonial times it was traded internationally and even used in European medicine.
Modern science has validated many traditional uses, finding genuine antimicrobial
and wound-healing properties.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🚀 Explosive Seeds">

When Targuá seed capsules dry out, they split open violently, literally exploding
and launching seeds several meters from the parent tree. This ballistic dispersal
is supplemented by birds eating any remaining seeds, ensuring the pioneer species
can quickly colonize distant disturbed areas.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🌡️ Climate Hero">

As a fast-growing pioneer species, Targuá captures carbon dioxide rapidly during
its short life. In areas recovering from deforestation, stands of Targuá can
sequester significant carbon while preparing the site for longer-lived forest
trees. This makes it valuable for both restoration and climate mitigation.
