# Cocobolo (Central American Rosewood)

<Callout type="warning" title="A Beauty in Peril">
  The **Cocobolo** (_Dalbergia retusa_), one of the world's most spectacular and
  valuable rosewoods, is a treasure of Central American dry forests—and a
  species in crisis. Its stunning wood, with swirling patterns of orange, red,
  yellow, and black, has commanded prices of **$100-300 per board foot** and has
  been sought by craftsmen for centuries. This demand has driven the species to
  **Vulnerable status** with heavy logging continuing. CITES protection now
  regulates international trade, but enforcement remains challenging.

## Physical Description

### Overall Form

The Cocobolo is a medium-sized tree of dry forests, typically growing with a short, often crooked trunk and irregular crown. It is deciduous, losing leaves in the dry season. The tree's value lies in its heartwood, which develops the spectacular colors that have made it famous.

## Conservation Status

### A Species in Crisis

<Callout type="warning" title="IUCN & CITES Status">
  **IUCN Red List**: Vulnerable (population decreasing) **CITES**: Appendix II
  (all _Dalbergia_ species) Since 2017, ALL _Dalbergia_ species have been
  included in CITES Appendix II, meaning international trade requires permits
  and documentation. This was in response to catastrophic logging of rosewood
  species worldwide, with Asian demand driving a logging crisis across the
  tropics.
</Callout>

### Threat Assessment

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Primary Threats

- **Illegal Logging**: Continues despite regulations
- **Habitat Loss**: Dry forest conversion to agriculture
- **Slow Growth**: Cannot sustain harvest pressure
- **High Value**: Economic incentive for poaching
- **Poor Enforcement**: Limited resources for protection

</Column>
<Column>

#### Population Status

- **Wild Trees**: Severely depleted
- **Large Trees**: Extremely rare
- **Regeneration**: Limited in remaining habitat
- **Genetic Diversity**: Concerns about bottlenecks

## Ecological Significance

### Dry Forest Ecosystem

<FeatureBox title="Part of a Threatened Ecosystem" icon="🌿">
  Cocobolo is endemic to the **Mesoamerican dry forest**, one of the most
  endangered ecosystems in the world. Less than 2% of original Central American
  dry forest remains intact. By protecting Cocobolo, we protect the entire dry
  forest ecosystem—its unique wildlife, other endemic plants, and the ecological
  services these forests provide including watershed protection and carbon
  storage.
</FeatureBox>

### Wildlife Interactions

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Pollinators

- **Bees**: Primary pollinators
- **Other Insects**: Various visitors
- **Timing**: Flowers in dry season

#### Seed Dispersal

- **Wind**: Flat pods catch breeze
- **Gravity**: Fall beneath parent tree
- **Germination**: Requires disturbance/light

</Column>
<Column>

#### Ecosystem Role

- **Nitrogen Fixation**: Legume root nodules
- **Dry Season Resource**: Flowers when little else does
- **Wildlife Habitat**: Cavity nesting, foraging substrate
- **Soil Building**: Deep roots, leaf litter

</Column>

## Cultivation & Restoration

### Growing Cocobolo

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Propagation

**From Seeds**

1. Collect ripe pods before they open
2. Extract seeds from pods
3. Scarify (nick seed coat) or hot water treatment
4. Sow in well-drained media
5. Germination in 1-4 weeks
6. Full sun from start

**Growth Characteristics**

- Slow growth (30-50 cm/year height)
- May take 60-80+ years for harvestable size
- Responds to management (pruning, spacing)

</Column>
<Column>

#### Growing Conditions

<SimpleList
  items={[
    "Sun: Full sun essential",
    "Soil: Well-drained, tolerates poor soils",
    "Water: Drought tolerant; no waterlogging",
    "Spacing: 6-10 m for plantations",
    "Frost: Tropical only; frost sensitive",
    "pH: 5.5-7.5",
  ]}
/>

#### Plantation Potential

- Being developed for sustainable production
- Requires long-term investment (50+ years)
- High-value crop for patient investors
- Supports conservation by reducing wild pressure

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

<Callout type="info" title="The Long View">
  Planting Cocobolo is an act of intergenerational faith. A tree planted today
  may not produce harvestable wood for 60-100 years. But as wild populations
  dwindle, plantation-grown Cocobolo offers the only sustainable path forward
  for this magnificent species and the craftsmen who work with it.

## Responsible Wood Sourcing

### Ethical Considerations

<Callout type="warning" title="Know Your Source">
  If you purchase Cocobolo wood or products: - **Demand documentation**: Legal
  CITES permits, chain of custody - **Ask questions**: Where was this harvested?
  Is it plantation grown? - **Consider alternatives**: Other beautiful woods
  exist - **Support plantations**: Sustainably grown is the future - **Report
  suspicious sources**: Illegal logging is a crime The best way to appreciate
  Cocobolo may be through vintage pieces, certified plantation wood, or small
  legally-sourced amounts for special projects.

<Callout type="tip" title="Protecting Cocobolo for the Future">
  The Cocobolo's story is both a warning and an opportunity. The warning: that
  even abundant species can be driven to rarity when demand outstrips
  sustainable supply. The opportunity: that with protection, responsible
  management, and plantation development, we can still save this magnificent
  tree and the tradition of fine craftsmanship it supports. Every
  conservation-minded purchase, every planted seedling, every enforced
  regulation helps secure the Cocobolo's future.
