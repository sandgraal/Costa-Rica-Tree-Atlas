# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "low"
skinContactRisk: "moderate"
allergenRisk: "high"
childSafe: true
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: true
toxicityDetails: "The wood itself is not significantly toxic if ingested (though wood should not be eaten). The tree is not a food plant. Main concerns are respiratory and dermatological from wood dust exposure during woodworking."
skinContactDetails: "ALLERGIC REACTIONS FROM WOOD DUST: Cocobolo wood contains dalbergione and other quinones that are potent sensitizers. Handling the wood, especially sawdust and fine particles, can cause severe allergic contact dermatitis with itching, redness, blistering, and rash. Reactions can occur after first exposure or develop with repeated contact. Some woodworkers develop persistent sensitivity. Fresh-cut wood and sawdust present highest risk. Wear gloves when handling. Reactions similar to poison ivy/oak but from different chemical compounds."
allergenDetails: "SEVERE RESPIRATORY HAZARD FOR WOODWORKERS: Cocobolo dust is one of the most allergenic woods in the world. Inhalation of dust can cause respiratory sensitization, asthma, allergic rhinitis, nosebleeds, and severe breathing difficulties. Some individuals develop chronic respiratory problems. Wood dust is classified as a known respiratory sensitizer. Dust particles can also cause eye irritation and conjunctivitis. ALWAYS use proper dust collection, respirators, and ventilation when working cocobolo. Even brief exposure can sensitize susceptible individuals. Once sensitized, reactions worsen with subsequent exposure."
structuralRiskDetails: "The tree itself is not a structural hazard. It is relatively small and slow-growing. However, the CRITICALLY ENDANGERED status means cutting living trees is illegal in most jurisdictions. Work only with legally sourced, certified wood from managed plantations or salvaged sources."
safetyNotes: "WOODWORKERS WARNING: If you work with cocobolo wood, take this seriously - it is among the most allergenic woods. Use proper PPE: N95 or better respirator, dust collection at the source, good ventilation, gloves, and long sleeves. Clean work area thoroughly. Some woodworkers cannot continue working with cocobolo after sensitization. The finished product is generally safe once sealed. CONSERVATION: This tree is Critically Endangered (CITES Appendix II). Purchasing cocobolo supports habitat destruction unless from certified sustainable sources. Consider alternative woods."
wildlifeRisks: "Not toxic to wildlife or domestic animals. Safe for pets. The conservation concern is habitat loss from illegal logging, not animal toxicity."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "slow"
growthRateDetails: "1-2 ft/year (0.3-0.6 m/year) - VERY SLOW; takes 60-100+ years to reach merchantable timber size; conservation plantings are long-term investment"
matureSize: "15-25 m tall (50-80 ft), trunk diameter 30-60 cm; crown spread 10-15 m; relatively modest size for a timber tree"
hardiness: "Tropical dry forest specialist 0-600m; adapted to Pacific lowlands with pronounced dry season; sensitive to waterlogging and frost"
soilRequirements: "Well-drained soils ESSENTIAL - intolerant of waterlogging; prefers deep, fertile soils but tolerates rocky, thin dry forest soils; pH 6.0-7.5; limestone-derived soils in native range; drought-adapted once established"
waterNeeds: "low"
waterDetails: "LOW water needs once established - adapted to 6-month dry season in native Guanacaste habitat. Young trees (Years 1-3) need irrigation during dry season for survival. Mature trees thrive on 1000-2000mm annual rainfall with pronounced dry period. Overwatering is more harmful than underwatering. Deep infrequent watering preferred."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plant 6-10 m apart for timber plantations; 8-12 m for mixed conservation plantings; can be grown closer in agroforestry systems"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
  - "cuttings"
propagationDifficulty: "moderate"
plantingSeason: "Plant at START of rainy season (May-June) so tree establishes before first dry season; critical timing for survival"
maintenanceNeeds: "HIGH maintenance and patience required - this is 60-100 YEAR investment. Years 1-3 CRITICAL: water during dry season or seedlings die; protect from cattle/deer browse; weed control essential. Years 3-10: continued weed control, formative pruning to develop straight trunk for timber. Year 10+: minimal intervention, allow natural growth. LEGAL REQUIREMENTS: cultivation permits may be required; harvest requires government authorization; export requires CITES permits (Appendix II species). This is NOT a beginner tree. Slow growth tests patience. Best for dedicated conservation/reforestation projects or patient long-term timber investors."
commonProblems:
  - "SLOW GROWTH - extremely slow; frustrating for impatient growers; 60-100 years to harvest size"
  - "DRY SEASON MORTALITY - young trees die without irrigation in first 2-3 dry seasons"
  - "BROWSING - deer, cattle eat seedlings; protection required"
  - "WEED COMPETITION - young trees easily overtopped; aggressive weed control needed"
  - "ILLEGAL HARVEST - valuable trees may be poached; security concerns for mature plantations"
  - "CITES REGULATIONS - complex legal requirements for harvest, transport, export; obtain permits"
  - "CRITICALLY ENDANGERED status means habitat protection crucial; don't wild-harvest"
  - "Wood dust toxicity complicates timber processing; mills need special precautions"
  - "Market prices fluctuate; long investment period (60-100 years) has economic risks"
  - "Best for PATIENT conservation-minded growers, not quick profit seekers"

# Cocobolo (Central American Rosewood)

<Callout type="warning" title="A Beauty in Peril">
  The **Cocobolo** (_Dalbergia retusa_), one of the world's most spectacular and
  valuable rosewoods, is a treasure of Central American dry forests—and a
  species in crisis. Its stunning wood, with swirling patterns of orange, red,
  yellow, and black, has commanded prices of **$100-300 per board foot** and has
  been sought by craftsmen for centuries. This demand has driven the species to
  **Critically Endangered status** with heavy logging continuing. CITES
  protection now regulates international trade, but enforcement remains
  challenging.
