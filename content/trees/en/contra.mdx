## Physical & Botanical Description

- Evergreen shrub to small tree, usually **3-6 m** tall.
- Opposite to whorled leaves, glossy dark green, elliptic to obovate.
- Small white to greenish flowers in compact clusters.
- Fruits mature from green to red-purple and eventually dark.
- Root and bark tissues are chemically active and require safe handling.

In Costa Rica, contra appears in warm lowlands and foothills, especially in
secondary growth, fence lines, and mixed rural vegetation.

---

## Habitat & Ecology

- Occurs in disturbed forest edges, shrublands, and seasonally dry tropical
  zones.
- Flowers attract insects; fruits are consumed and dispersed by birds.
- Tolerates pruning and can regenerate from basal shoots after cutting.
- Useful as a hardy shrub in biodiversity strips when safely managed.

---

## Uses & Applications

### Ethnobotanical relevance

- Historically referenced in traditional medicine for cardiovascular and nervous
  system indications.
- Included in educational medicinal gardens and pharmacognosy collections.
- Used as a hedge plant in some tropical regions.

### Safety and ethics

Given its alkaloid profile, medicinal use should remain under qualified
clinical supervision.

---

## Conservation Status

**IUCN Red List:** Least Concern (LC).

Conservation concerns are mainly local and linked to habitat simplification and
loss of native shrublands, rather than global extinction risk.

---

## Growing Contra

1. Plant in well-drained sites with morning sun or partial shade.
2. Irrigate during the first two dry seasons for stronger root development.
3. Prune annually to maintain a stable multi-stem structure.
4. Use gloves during heavy pruning or root work.
5. Keep labels and safety notes in educational plantings.

Contra can be grown successfully in botanical collections, but should always be
managed as a toxic medicinal species.

---

## Where to See Contra in Costa Rica

- Rural hedgerows and secondary vegetation in **Guanacaste**.
- Lowland mixed-use landscapes of the **Central Pacific**.
- Caribbean foothill mosaics in **Sarapiqui** and nearby zones.
- Botanical and ethnobotanical educational gardens.
