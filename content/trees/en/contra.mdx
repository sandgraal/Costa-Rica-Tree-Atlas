## Physical & Botanical Description

- Evergreen shrub to small tree, usually **3-6 m** tall.
- Opposite to whorled leaves, glossy dark green, elliptic to obovate.
- Small white to greenish flowers in compact clusters.
- Fruits mature from green to red-purple and eventually dark.
- Root and bark tissues are chemically active and require safe handling.

---

## Geographic Distribution

<DistributionMap
  locale="en"
  countries={[

    "Nicaragua",
    "Panama",
    "Colombia",
    "Venezuela",
    "Brazil",

  ]}
  elevation="0-1400 m"
/>

In Costa Rica, contra appears in warm lowlands and foothills, especially in
secondary growth, fence lines, and mixed rural vegetation.

---

## Habitat & Ecology

- Occurs in disturbed forest edges, shrublands, and seasonally dry tropical
  zones.
- Flowers attract insects; fruits are consumed and dispersed by birds.
- Tolerates pruning and can regenerate from basal shoots after cutting.
- Useful as a hardy shrub in biodiversity strips when safely managed.

---

## Uses & Applications

### Ethnobotanical relevance

- Historically referenced in traditional medicine for cardiovascular and nervous
  system indications.
- Included in educational medicinal gardens and pharmacognosy collections.
- Used as a hedge plant in some tropical regions.

### Safety and ethics

Given its alkaloid profile, medicinal use should remain under qualified
clinical supervision.

---

## Conservation Status

**IUCN Red List:** Least Concern (LC).

Conservation concerns are mainly local and linked to habitat simplification and
loss of native shrublands, rather than global extinction risk.

---

## Growing Contra

1. Plant in well-drained sites with morning sun or partial shade.
2. Irrigate during the first two dry seasons for stronger root development.
3. Prune annually to maintain a stable multi-stem structure.
4. Use gloves during heavy pruning or root work.
5. Keep labels and safety notes in educational plantings.

Contra can be grown successfully in botanical collections, but should always be
managed as a toxic medicinal species.

---

## Advanced Care Guidance

### Site Design and Planting

- Plant in well-drained loam with full morning light and afternoon shade in hot
  lowland sites.
- Keep 2-3 m spacing for hedgerows and educational medicinal gardens.
- Place away from school play zones, pet runs, and edible-only garden beds due
  toxic alkaloids.

### Watering Program

- **Establishment (0-6 months):** Deep irrigation 1-2 times weekly in dry
  periods.
- **Juvenile phase (6-24 months):** Water every 10-14 days during drought if
  foliage wilts.
- **Established shrubs/trees:** Irrigate only during prolonged dry-season stress
  to maintain flowering and fruit set.

### Fertilization Schedule

- Add compost at planting and refresh organic mulch twice per year.
- Apply a moderate balanced fertilizer (for example 15-15-15) at early rainy
  season and once again mid season.
- Avoid excessive nitrogen that causes weak, overly succulent shoots.

### Pruning and Structure

- Maintain a controlled multi-stem form with annual thinning after fruiting.
- Remove inward or crossing branches to improve airflow and reduce pathogen
  pressure.
- Use gloves, long sleeves, and sanitation tools when handling roots, bark, and
  sap.

### Pest and Disease Management

- Watch for scale insects, mealybugs, and ant activity on young stems.
- Prevent root disease by avoiding standing water and compacted soils.
- Combine sanitation pruning, biological controls, and spot treatment only when
  pressure exceeds tolerance.

### Companion Planting

- **Recommended companions:** Native hedgerow shrubs, pollinator herbs, and
  clearly labeled medicinal species collections.
- **Agroforestry role:** Biodiversity strip component and medicinal education
  plant where risk is managed.
- **Avoid nearby:** High-traffic children areas, unmarked edible gardens, and
  forage zones for pets or livestock.

### Seasonal Care Calendar (Costa Rican Conditions)

- **Dry season (Dec-Apr):** Safety inspections, targeted irrigation, and light
  canopy cleanup.
- **Early rains (May-Jul):** Main fertilization window, replanting, and
  structural pruning.
- **Peak rains (Aug-Oct):** Drainage checks, fungal scouting, and minimal heavy
  cuts.
- **Transition (Nov):** Label maintenance, sanitation cycle, and preparation for
  dry-season monitoring.

### Growth Timeline and Management Notes

- Establishes as a functional hedge in year 1 and develops stronger woody form
  by years 2-3.
- Fruiting and medicinal-collection maturity typically improve from years 2-4.
- Long-term success depends on consistent safety labeling and controlled access.

---

## Field Identification and Similar Species

### High-confidence visual cues

- Leaves are opposite to whorled and usually glossy, with a compact evergreen
  appearance in warm sites.
- Flower clusters are small and pale (white to greenish), less showy than many
  ornamental shrubs.
- Fruits transition from green to red-purple and then dark when fully mature.
- Multi-stem habit is common in managed hedges and disturbed-edge populations.
- Root-zone tissues and bark are not visually diagnostic on their own; combine
  vegetative and reproductive features for reliable identification.

      "Young forest-edge saplings",
      "Many juveniles share similar leaf color and texture",
      "Use reproductive characters plus habitat context",
    ],
  ]}
/>

### Risk-aware identification protocol

1. Confirm scientific identity before any medicinal interpretation or collection
   discussion.
2. Document leaves, flowers, and fruit stage in the same specimen whenever
   possible.
3. Keep location and habitat notes because disturbance context helps narrow
   likely species.
4. Avoid root disturbance during uncertain identification because roots are among
   the highest-risk tissues.
5. Escalate uncertain records to botanists or herbarium-supported references.

## Controlled Cultivation Playbook

### Educational medicinal gardens

- Maintain clear species labeling that includes toxicity warning language.
- Separate contra physically from culinary and child-interaction zones.
- Use lockable tool protocols for root and bark handling tasks.
- Keep documented maintenance logs for pruning, waste disposal, and visitor
  incidents.

### Living hedge applications

- Train as a managed multistem hedge with annual structural cycles.
- Keep lower canopy transparent enough for visual monitoring and signage
  visibility.
- Avoid placement along school entrances or high-contact recreation corridors.
- Remove volunteer seedlings outside designated hedge boundaries.

### Biodiversity strip integration

- Combine with non-toxic pollinator shrubs to diversify flowering resources.
- Use contra in clearly designated zones where controlled educational value is
  relevant.
- Keep maintenance staff trained on plant-specific PPE and first-response
  protocols.
- Retain moderate height profiles to reduce branch-contact risk near pathways.

### Waste handling and sanitation

- Bag and remove pruning residues from public-access areas the same day.
- Avoid composting roots and bark in community-access compost piles.
- Sanitize tools after each maintenance cycle to reduce disease carryover.
- Record disposal routes for institutional gardens with compliance requirements.
