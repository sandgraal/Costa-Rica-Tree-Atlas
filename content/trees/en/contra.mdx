## Physical & Botanical Description

- Evergreen shrub to small tree, usually **3-6 m** tall.
- Opposite to whorled leaves, glossy dark green, elliptic to obovate.
- Small white to greenish flowers in compact clusters.
- Fruits mature from green to red-purple and eventually dark.
- Root and bark tissues are chemically active and require safe handling.

In Costa Rica, contra appears in warm lowlands and foothills, especially in
secondary growth, fence lines, and mixed rural vegetation.

---

## Habitat & Ecology

- Occurs in disturbed forest edges, shrublands, and seasonally dry tropical
  zones.
- Flowers attract insects; fruits are consumed and dispersed by birds.
- Tolerates pruning and can regenerate from basal shoots after cutting.
- Useful as a hardy shrub in biodiversity strips when safely managed.

---

## Uses & Applications

### Ethnobotanical relevance

- Historically referenced in traditional medicine for cardiovascular and nervous
  system indications.
- Included in educational medicinal gardens and pharmacognosy collections.
- Used as a hedge plant in some tropical regions.

### Safety and ethics

Given its alkaloid profile, medicinal use should remain under qualified
clinical supervision.

---

## Conservation Status

**IUCN Red List:** Least Concern (LC).

Conservation concerns are mainly local and linked to habitat simplification and
loss of native shrublands, rather than global extinction risk.

---

## Growing Contra

1. Plant in well-drained sites with morning sun or partial shade.
2. Irrigate during the first two dry seasons for stronger root development.
3. Prune annually to maintain a stable multi-stem structure.
4. Use gloves during heavy pruning or root work.
5. Keep labels and safety notes in educational plantings.

Contra can be grown successfully in botanical collections, but should always be
managed as a toxic medicinal species.

---

## Advanced Care Guidance

### Site Design and Planting

- Plant in well-drained loam with full morning light and afternoon shade in hot
  lowland sites.
- Keep 2-3 m spacing for hedgerows and educational medicinal gardens.
- Place away from school play zones, pet runs, and edible-only garden beds due
  toxic alkaloids.

### Watering Program

- **Establishment (0-6 months):** Deep irrigation 1-2 times weekly in dry
  periods.
- **Juvenile phase (6-24 months):** Water every 10-14 days during drought if
  foliage wilts.
- **Established shrubs/trees:** Irrigate only during prolonged dry-season stress
  to maintain flowering and fruit set.

### Fertilization Schedule

- Add compost at planting and refresh organic mulch twice per year.
- Apply a moderate balanced fertilizer (for example 15-15-15) at early rainy
  season and once again mid season.
- Avoid excessive nitrogen that causes weak, overly succulent shoots.

### Pruning and Structure

- Maintain a controlled multi-stem form with annual thinning after fruiting.
- Remove inward or crossing branches to improve airflow and reduce pathogen
  pressure.
- Use gloves, long sleeves, and sanitation tools when handling roots, bark, and
  sap.

### Pest and Disease Management

- Watch for scale insects, mealybugs, and ant activity on young stems.
- Prevent root disease by avoiding standing water and compacted soils.
- Combine sanitation pruning, biological controls, and spot treatment only when
  pressure exceeds tolerance.

### Companion Planting

- **Recommended companions:** Native hedgerow shrubs, pollinator herbs, and
  clearly labeled medicinal species collections.
- **Agroforestry role:** Biodiversity strip component and medicinal education
  plant where risk is managed.
- **Avoid nearby:** High-traffic children areas, unmarked edible gardens, and
  forage zones for pets or livestock.

### Seasonal Care Calendar (Costa Rican Conditions)

- **Dry season (Dec-Apr):** Safety inspections, targeted irrigation, and light
  canopy cleanup.
- **Early rains (May-Jul):** Main fertilization window, replanting, and
  structural pruning.
- **Peak rains (Aug-Oct):** Drainage checks, fungal scouting, and minimal heavy
  cuts.
- **Transition (Nov):** Label maintenance, sanitation cycle, and preparation for
  dry-season monitoring.

### Growth Timeline and Management Notes

- Establishes as a functional hedge in year 1 and develops stronger woody form
  by years 2-3.
- Fruiting and medicinal-collection maturity typically improve from years 2-4.
- Long-term success depends on consistent safety labeling and controlled access.

## Where to See Contra in Costa Rica

- Rural hedgerows and secondary vegetation in **Guanacaste**.
- Lowland mixed-use landscapes of the **Central Pacific**.
- Caribbean foothill mosaics in **Sarapiqui** and nearby zones.
- Botanical and ethnobotanical educational gardens.
