  - "sap"
  - "seeds"
  - "all"
skinContactRisk: "severe"
allergenRisk: "moderate"
structuralRisks:
  - "sharp-spines"
  - "explosive-pods"
childSafe: false
petSafe: false
requiresProfessionalCare: true
toxicityDetails: "All parts of the Javillo are highly toxic. The milky latex contains hurin and creptin (toxic proteins) that cause severe poisoning if ingested. Seeds resemble edible nuts but are EXTREMELY TOXIC—just 1-2 seeds can be fatal to children. Historical use as arrow poison and fish poison demonstrates extreme toxicity. Ingestion causes violent vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and can lead to death. Seeds contain potent toxins that affect the nervous system."
skinContactDetails: "The milky sap (latex) is HIGHLY CAUSTIC and causes immediate severe chemical burns on contact with skin. Burns develop rapidly into painful blisters. Eye contact causes excruciating pain, temporary or permanent blindness, and corneal damage. Sap can spray when tree is cut or damaged. Indigenous peoples historically used this sap as arrow poison. Even brief skin contact requires immediate washing. Wear full protective equipment when working near this tree."
allergenDetails: "Pollen and sap particles can cause respiratory irritation and allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. Wood dust from cutting can cause severe respiratory distress."
structuralRiskDetails: "EXPLOSIVE SEED PODS: The pumpkin-shaped seed capsules (8-15 cm diameter) explode with tremendous force when ripe, creating a sound like a gunshot. Seeds are launched at speeds up to 250 km/h (70 m/s) and travel distances of 40-100 meters. This explosion can cause serious injury if struck—particularly dangerous to eyes and face. SHARP SPINES: Trunk and branches covered in conical woody spines 1-5 cm long that can cause deep puncture wounds. Spines present throughout tree's entire life."
safetyNotes: "This is one of the most dangerous trees in the Western Hemisphere. NEVER touch the sap, NEVER consume any part, NEVER stand under during fruiting season. Avoid planting near homes, schools, parks, or public areas. Indigenous Caribs used sap-poisoned arrows for warfare. The tree should only be handled by professionals with full protective equipment including face shields, gloves, and protective clothing. Keep children and pets far away. Do not burn wood—smoke is toxic."
wildlifeRisks: "Seeds are toxic to most mammals including livestock, dogs, and cats. However, some birds and specialized mammals (agoutis, peccaries) can eat seeds safely. Domestic animals should be kept away from this tree."
# Care & Cultivation

waterDetails: "Moderate water needs. Prefers moist conditions but drought-tolerant once established. Often found along streams and in periodically flooded areas. Young trees need regular water during establishment. Mature trees survive dry season without irrigation."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plant AT LEAST 30+ meters from buildings, schools, parks, playgrounds, walkways, and ANY public areas - EXTREMELY DANGEROUS tree; NOT suitable for 99.9% of landscapes"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
propagationDifficulty: "easy"
plantingSeason: "Start of rainy season (May-June); seeds germinate readily"
maintenanceNeeds: "DO NOT PLANT THIS TREE unless in remote conservation/research setting far from all human activity. This tree is fundamentally incompatible with human spaces due to: (1) SEVERELY TOXIC caustic sap causes blindness and chemical burns, (2) EXPLOSIVE seed pods launch seeds at 250 km/h - serious injury risk, (3) Sharp spines cause puncture wounds, (4) ALL PARTS FATALLY TOXIC if ingested. NO pruning, NO maintenance should be attempted without full hazmat protection, face shield, and professional expertise. Even trained arborists avoid this species. LEGAL LIABILITY concerns if planted near any occupied areas. Best use: deep forest conservation areas only. IF inherited on property: establish 50+ meter safety perimeter, post warning signs, consider professional removal."
commonProblems:
  - "EXTREME HUMAN SAFETY HAZARD - caustic sap, explosive pods, toxic seeds, sharp spines"
  - "LEGAL LIABILITY if planted near homes, schools, parks, or public areas"
  - "Explosive seed pods (Apr-Jun) create loud bangs and launch seeds at 250 km/h"
  - "Seeds resemble edible nuts but are FATALLY TOXIC - extreme danger to children"
  - "Sap causes IMMEDIATE chemical burns and BLINDNESS - no safe pruning method"
  - "Conical spines 1-5 cm cause deep puncture wounds throughout tree's life"
  - "Falling branches/limbs from 30-60m height extremely dangerous"
  - "Cannot be safely removed once mature - sap hazard during cutting"
  - "Wood smoke is TOXIC - cannot burn for fuel"
  - "This tree should NEVER be planted intentionally in modern settings"
  - "ONLY appropriate for remote forest conservation far from human access"

## Ecological Importance

### Despite the Danger...

<Callout type="success" title="An Ecological Powerhouse">
  Despite its fearsome defenses, the Javillo plays vital ecosystem roles: -
  **Canopy Giant**: Creates forest structure, microhabitats - **Seed Dispersal
  Innovation**: Explosive dispersal colonizes gaps - **Food Source**: Some
  animals tolerate toxins - **Nesting Sites**: Large branches, cavities -
  **Shade Provider**: Dense canopy in forest gaps - **Carbon Storage**: Massive
  biomass accumulation The tree's defenses evolved against now-extinct
  megafauna—it's over- defended for today's world but remains ecologically
  important.

## Ethnobotanical Uses

### Traditional Uses

<FeatureBox title="Indigenous Knowledge" icon="🎣">
  Despite its toxicity, indigenous peoples developed uses for Javillo: - **Fish
  Poison**: Sap and seeds stupefied fish for easy catching - **Arrow Poison**:
  Toxic latex on hunting arrows - **Medicine**: Carefully prepared for specific
  ailments - **Purgative**: Controlled doses as powerful laxative - **Ritual**:
  Seeds used in ceremonies (careful handling) These uses required extensive
  traditional knowledge—DO NOT attempt!
</FeatureBox>

### Colonial "Sandbox" Use

<Callout type="info" title="The Sandbox Tree Name">
  In colonial times, before blotting paper was common, the dried seed pods were
  used as desk accessories: 1. Pods were collected after explosion (or carefully
  dried to prevent it) 2. Hollow segments were filled with fine sand 3. Placed
  on desks as inkwells or sand shakers 4. Sand was sprinkled on wet ink to dry
  it quickly This is how the tree got its English name "Sandbox Tree"—a curious
  bit of colonial-era office supply history!

## The Explosive Mechanism

### How the Pods Explode

<FeatureBox title="Nature's Ballistic Seed Launcher" icon="💥">
  The Javillo's seed dispersal is a marvel of botanical engineering: 1. **Pod
  Development**: Fruit grows as segmented capsule 2. **Drying Phase**: As pod
  dries, tissues contract unevenly 3. **Tension Builds**: Outer layers shrink
  faster than inner 4. **Critical Point**: Tension exceeds structural strength
  5. **EXPLOSION**: Pod shatters along segment lines 6. **Seed Launch**: Seeds
  ejected at ~70 m/s (250 km/h!) 7. **Distance**: Seeds travel up to 100 m from
  parent tree The explosion sounds like a gunshot and can be heard from far
  away. It's one of the most dramatic seed dispersal mechanisms in nature.
</FeatureBox>

<Callout type="tip" title="Witnessing an Explosion">
  To safely observe (from a distance!): - **Timing**: Dry season, when pods are
  mature - **Conditions**: Hot, dry days trigger more explosions - **Distance**:
  Stay at least 50 meters from trees with ripe pods - **Sound**: Listen for
  gunshot-like bangs - **Aftermath**: Look for pod fragments and scattered seeds
  Never collect ripe pods—they can explode in your hands or car!
