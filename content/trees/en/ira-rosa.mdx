### Etymology

The genus name _Brownea_ honors Patrick Browne (1720-1790), an Irish physician and botanist who studied the flora of Jamaica and published the influential "Civil and Natural History of Jamaica" (1756). The species epithet _macrophylla_ comes from Greek _makros_ (large) + _phyllon_ (leaf), referring to the tree's large compound leaves with big leaflets.

### Related Species

The genus _Brownea_ contains about 20-25 species of tropical trees, several of which are notable for spectacular flowers:

- **_Brownea grandiceps_**: Similar but with even larger flower heads
- **_Brownea rosa-de-monte_**: Venezuelan relative
- **_Brownea ariza_**: Red flowers, found in Colombia and Venezuela

---

## Physical Description

### Tree Form

**Ira Rosa** is a medium-sized evergreen tree typically reaching 15-25 meters in height with a trunk diameter of 30-50 cm. The tree has an elegant form:

- **Trunk**: Straight, relatively slender, smooth gray-brown bark
- **Crown**: Rounded to spreading, moderately dense canopy
- **Branching**: Upright to spreading branches, often layered
- **Growth Pattern**: Evergreen; maintains foliage year-round

### Bark Characteristics

- Smooth to slightly rough texture
- Gray-brown to dark gray color
- Becomes slightly fissured with age but remains relatively smooth
- Lenticels (breathing pores) visible on younger bark
- Flowers emerge directly from bark on trunk and older branches

### Leaves

    label="Type"
    value="Pinnately compound (even-pinnate)"
  />
  <PropertyCard icon="📏" label="Length" value="30-60 cm overall" />
  <PropertyCard icon="🌿" label="Leaflets" value="6-16 pairs" />
  <PropertyCard icon="📐" label="Leaflet Size" value="8-15 cm long" />
  <PropertyCard icon="🎨" label="Color" value="Dark green, glossy" />
  <PropertyCard icon="🔄" label="Arrangement" value="Alternate on branches" />
</PropertiesGrid>

**Detail**: Each compound leaf consists of 6-16 pairs of large, opposite leaflets arranged along a central rachis. Leaflets are elliptic to oblong, 8-15 cm long, with smooth margins and a slightly asymmetric base. The upper surface is dark green and glossy, while the lower surface is paler. New leaves emerge in a spectacular display—they hang limp like colorful pendants, starting pink or bronze, gradually turning green and stiffening as they mature over several days. This "pink leaf" stage is a distinctive feature of _Brownea_ species.

### Flowers

<PropertiesGrid>
  <PropertyCard icon="🌸" label="Color" value="Bright red to red-orange" />
  <PropertyCard icon="📐" label="Cluster Size" value="20-30 cm diameter" />
  <PropertyCard icon="🌺" label="Form" value="Dense spherical clusters" />

  <PropertyCard icon="📅" label="Season" value="February-May (peak)" />
  <PropertyCard icon="🐝" label="Pollination" value="Hummingbirds, bats" />
</PropertiesGrid>

**Description**: The flowers are the tree's most spectacular feature. They are produced in large, dense, spherical clusters (capitula) 20-30 cm in diameter that emerge directly from the trunk and older branches—a phenomenon called **cauliflory**. Each cluster contains numerous individual tubular flowers, each 3-5 cm long, bright red to red-orange in color. The long stamens project beyond the flower tubes, creating a bottle-brush appearance. Flowers have a subtle sweet fragrance and produce nectar that attracts pollinators. The floral display can last several weeks, and a mature tree may produce dozens of flower clusters simultaneously, covering the trunk in flames of red.

### Fruit & Seeds

- **Type**: Flattened legume pod (typical of Fabaceae family)
- **Size**: 15-25 cm long, 4-6 cm wide
- **Color**: Green when young, turning brown when mature
- **Opening**: Splits along two sutures when ripe
- **Seeds**: 3-8 large, flat, brown seeds per pod
- **Season**: June-September

### Ecological Role

In its natural rainforest habitat, Ira Rosa plays important ecological functions:

1. **Pollinator Support**: Major nectar source for hummingbirds, bats, and bees during flowering season
2. **Canopy Layer**: Forms part of the mid-canopy in mature forests
3. **Wildlife Food**: Seeds consumed by various mammals and birds
4. **Forest Regeneration**: Relatively shade-tolerant as a young tree; can regenerate in forest gaps

### Wildlife Associations

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="Pollinators">

The spectacular flowers attract diverse pollinators:

**Hummingbirds**:

- Long-billed species like hermits (_Phaethornis_ spp.) are primary pollinators
- Violet Sabrewing (_Campylopterus hemileucurus_)
- Green-crowned Brilliant (_Heliodoxa jacula_)
- Numerous other hummingbird species visit flowers for nectar

**Bats**:

- Nectar-feeding bats visit flowers at night
- Likely play a significant pollination role

**Bees and Other Insects**:

- Large carpenter bees (_Xylocopa_ spp.)
- Stingless bees (_Melipona_, _Trigona_ spp.)
- Various other bee species

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="Seed Dispersers">

Seeds are dispersed by:

- **Agoutis and Pacas**: Feed on fallen pods and cache seeds
- **Parrots**: May feed on developing seeds in pods
- **Gravity**: Pods fall and open beneath parent tree
- **Water**: Seeds can float and disperse in streams during flooding

</AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

### Cauliflory: Trunk Flowering

The phenomenon of **cauliflory**—flowers emerging directly from the trunk and older branches rather than from twig tips—is an adaptation common in tropical rainforest understory and mid-canopy trees. Proposed advantages include:

1. **Pollinator Access**: Large pollinators (bats, large birds) can more easily access flowers on sturdy trunks
2. **Visibility**: Flowers on bare trunk are more visible in dense forest
3. **Resource Allocation**: Older woody tissue can support heavy flower and fruit clusters
