# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "low"
toxicParts:
  - "bark (tannins)"
skinContactRisk: "none"
allergenRisk: "low"
structuralRisks:
  - "slippery-substrate"
childSafe: true
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "White mangrove bark contains moderate concentrations of tannins which give it astringent properties. The tannins are not highly toxic but can cause mild stomach upset if bark is consumed in large quantities. Leaves and fruits are not toxic. Not a concern for casual contact with the tree."
skinContactDetails: "Safe for skin contact. No irritation from leaves, bark, or sap. The salt glands on leaf petioles are harmless to touch. No reports of skin sensitivity or dermatitis from this species."
allergenDetails: "Low allergen risk. Flowers are small and inconspicuous, producing minimal pollen. Some individuals may experience very mild respiratory irritation during heavy flowering. No significant allergic reactions documented."
structuralRiskDetails: "The main hazard is the muddy, slippery substrate where white mangroves grow, especially during low tide. The inland location means fewer prop roots to trip over compared to red mangrove, but footing can still be unstable. Stay on designated paths in protected mangrove areas."
safetyNotes: "White mangrove is a safe species with critical ecological value. Generally found further inland than red and black mangroves, at the upper limit of tidal influence. Protected species in coastal zones - check local regulations before disturbing. Essential component of mangrove ecosystem succession."
wildlifeRisks: "Safe for all wildlife. Provides important habitat for birds, crabs, insects, and serves as food source for various species. Not toxic to marine life or terrestrial animals."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "moderate"
growthRateDetails: "2-3 ft/year in ideal conditions; growth rate similar to red mangrove"
matureSize: "12-18 m tall (40-60 ft), often multi-trunked; forms the upper zone of mangrove forests"
hardiness: "Coastal tropical and subtropical zones 0-5m elevation; tolerates wider salinity range than red mangrove; grows above high tide line"
soilRequirements: "Tolerates brackish to saline conditions; can grow in less frequently inundated areas; prefers silt, clay, sand, or peat substrates"
waterNeeds: "high"
waterDetails: "Requires periodic tidal inundation but can tolerate less frequent flooding than red mangrove. Grows in upper tidal zones where water levels reach surface but not daily inundation. Salt tolerance up to 90 ppt, optimal at 15-20 ppt salinity. Can survive short dry periods."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plant 2-3 m apart for restoration; naturally forms mixed stands with other mangrove species"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds (propagules)"
  - "cuttings"
propagationDifficulty: "easy"
plantingSeason: "Plant during wet season for best establishment; year-round possible in ideal conditions"
maintenanceNeeds: "LOW MAINTENANCE in natural settings. White mangrove thrives in upper tidal zones with minimal intervention. For restoration: (1) Plant in appropriate elevation zone - above daily high tide but within periodic tidal reach, (2) Protect seedlings from herbivory during first 6 months, (3) No fertilization needed - adapted to coastal nutrient cycling, (4) Allow natural salt gland function - tree self-regulates salt balance, (5) Monitor for proper hydrology - requires periodic saltwater contact."
commonProblems:
  - "Planting in wrong elevation zone - requires upper tidal zone, not daily inundation"
  - "Excessive freshwater flooding can stress trees"
  - "Land crabs may damage young seedlings"
  - "Coastal development and habitat loss"
  - "Oil spills and pollution impacts"
  - "Climate change altering suitable habitat zones"
  - "Erosion from storm surges"

## Physical Description

### General Form

The White Mangrove is a medium-sized evergreen tree or large shrub with a variable growth form depending on environmental conditions. Unlike the red mangrove's dramatic prop roots, white mangrove typically develops a more conventional root system, though it may produce pneumatophores (breathing roots) or stilt roots in frequently flooded areas. The crown is rounded and dense with leathery foliage.

  no other mangrove species has this feature. Look for two small bumps near the
  base of each leaf where it attaches to the stem. These glands actively excrete
  salt, sometimes visible as white crystals.

## Adaptations to Coastal Life

### Salt Management Strategy

<FeatureBox title="The Salt Gland Innovation" icon="💧">
  White mangrove's most remarkable adaptation: **How It Works**: 1. **Uptake**:
  Roots absorb water with high salt content 2. **Transport**: Salt moves through
  xylem to leaves 3. **Concentration**: Salt accumulates in specialized cells 4.
  **Excretion**: Glands on petioles actively pump out excess salt 5. **Result**:
  Salt crystals form on gland surface This sophisticated system allows white
  mangrove to thrive where most plants would die from salt toxicity.
</FeatureBox>

<Callout type="success" title="Guardian of the Upper Tides">
  The White Mangrove may not have the dramatic prop roots of its red cousin or
  the striking pneumatophores of the black mangrove, but its role is equally
  vital. As the bridge between sea and land, it stabilizes coastal boundaries,
  provides critical wildlife habitat, and demonstrates nature's ingenuity in
  adapting to one of Earth's most challenging environments. Its simple salt
  glands—visible as tiny bumps on leaf stalks—represent millions of years of
  evolution solving the problem of thriving in salt water. Every white mangrove
  forest is a living buffer zone, protecting both marine and terrestrial
  ecosystems while storing carbon and supporting biodiversity.
