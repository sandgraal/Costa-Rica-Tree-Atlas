toxicityDetails: "Caña India (Dracaena) is mildly toxic if ingested. The leaves contain saponins which can cause stomach upset, vomiting, and diarrhea in humans if consumed. However, the plant is not typically eaten by people (bitter taste). Most concerning is TOXICITY TO PETS - particularly cats and dogs. Ingestion causes drooling, vomiting, dilated pupils, increased heart rate, and loss of appetite in pets. While rarely fatal, it causes significant distress and requires veterinary care."
skinContactDetails: "Mild skin irritation possible from sap, particularly in sensitive individuals. May cause contact dermatitis. The sap is sticky. Most people handle the plant without issue when propagating cuttings for living fences."
safetyNotes: "Safe for human planting and use as living fences (extremely common throughout Costa Rica). Children are unlikely to eat the leaves due to bitter taste. However, DO NOT plant where pets (especially cats and dogs) can access the leaves. This is one of the most common houseplants globally but is listed by ASPCA as toxic to pets. Indoor potted plants should be placed where pets cannot reach. The plant is otherwise safe and culturally important - used throughout rural Costa Rica as living fence posts."
wildlifeRisks: "TOXIC TO CATS AND DOGS - causes gastrointestinal upset, drooling, dilated pupils. Also toxic to horses if ingested in quantity. Keep away from domestic animals. Birds and wild animals typically do not consume this plant."

# Caña India (Corn Plant)

<Callout type="success" title="Costa Rica's Living Fences">
  The **Caña India** (_Dracaena fragrans_), though native to tropical Africa,
  has become so deeply integrated into Costa Rican rural life that it defines
  the country's agricultural landscape. Rows of these tall, palm-like plants
  mark property boundaries, form living fences, and during the dry season
  release an intoxicating sweet fragrance from their night-blooming flowers.

## Physical Description

### Overall Form

Caña India grows as an unbranched or sparingly branched tree-like plant with a distinctive rosette of long, strap-shaped leaves at the top. The thick, woody stem stores water, and the plant can reach impressive heights over many years. Multiple trunks often grow together when planted as cuttings, creating the characteristic living fence appearance.

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Fragrance Characteristics

- Sweet, honey-like notes
- Detectable from great distance
- Strongest at night
- Peaks in evening hours
- Lessens in daylight
- Associated with dry season

</Column>
<Column>

#### Ecological Purpose

- Attracts nocturnal moths
- Hawk moths primary pollinators
- Night-blooming strategy

## Living Fences: A Costa Rican Tradition

### Cercas Vivas

<Callout type="success" title="Sustainable Infrastructure">
  The living fence (cerca viva) is a cornerstone of sustainable Costa Rican
  agriculture. Caña India, along with Poró and other species, creates fences
  that never need replacing, provide wildlife corridors, prevent erosion, mark
  boundaries, and contribute to the farm's productivity—all from cuttings simply
  stuck in the ground.
</Callout>

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### How It Works

1. Cut mature stems into 1-2m sections
2. Plant directly in ground
3. Roots develop rapidly
4. New leaves sprout from top
5. Grows into mature plant
6. Lasts indefinitely

</Column>
<Column>

#### Benefits Over Wire Fences

- No purchase cost
- Never needs replacement
- Provides shade for livestock
- Prevents erosion
- Wildlife corridor
- Carbon storage
- Produces flowers/fragrance

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

### Landscape Impact

<Callout type="info" title="Defining the Rural Landscape">
  Flying over Costa Rica's Central Valley or driving through rural areas, you'll
  see countless lines of Caña India marking property boundaries, lining roads,
  and dividing pastures. This introduced African plant has become so essential
  to the Costa Rican landscape that it's hard to imagine the countryside without
  it.
</Callout>

## Distribution in Costa Rica

<Callout type="info" title="Where to Find It">
  Caña India is found throughout Costa Rica wherever there is human settlement.
  It's most abundant in the Central Valley and mid-elevation agricultural zones,
  but also thrives in coastal areas and even in some montane regions. You'll
  rarely find it truly wild—it's almost always associated with cultivation.

## Indoor Plant Fame

### World's Most Popular Houseplant

<Callout type="info" title="Global Celebrity">
  While Costa Ricans know Caña India as a fence post, the rest of the world
  knows it as one of the most popular indoor plants. It thrives in low light,
  tolerates neglect, and purifies indoor air. NASA research famously included it
  among plants most effective at removing indoor air pollutants.
</Callout>

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Indoor Benefits

- Tolerates low light
- Survives irregular watering
- Removes formaldehyde
- Filters benzene
- Adds oxygen
- Easy propagation

</Column>
<Column>

#### Popular Cultivars

- 'Massangeana': Yellow-striped leaves
- 'Lindenii': White-edged leaves
- 'Victoria': Compact, variegated
- 'Janet Craig': All-green, tough
- 'Lemon Lime': Bright yellow margins

    ["Propagation", "Stem cuttings", "Extremely easy"],
  ]}
/>

### Propagation

<Callout type="success" title="Easiest Plant to Propagate">
  Caña India may be the easiest plant in the world to propagate. Simply cut a
  section of stem (any length from 15cm to 2m), stick it in soil, and it will
  root. This works with no rooting hormone, in any season, in nearly any soil.
  This ease of propagation is why it became so popular for living fences.

## Interesting Facts

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="🌍 From Africa to Costa Rica">

Despite being called "Caña India" (Indian cane), this plant is actually native
to tropical Africa—from Sudan to Mozambique. It was brought to the Americas
during the colonial era, possibly via Asian trade routes, which may explain the
"India" misnomer. It has become so naturalized in Costa Rica that many people
assume it's native.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🌙 Night Pollinators">

The intensely fragrant night-blooming flowers evolved to attract hawk moths
(Sphingidae). These large moths hover like hummingbirds while extending their
extremely long tongues to reach nectar. The white color and strong fragrance
are classic moth-pollination adaptations—maximizing visibility and detectability
in darkness.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🏠 NASA-Certified Air Purifier">

In NASA's famous Clean Air Study, Dracaena fragrans was identified as one of
the most effective plants for removing indoor air pollutants, particularly
formaldehyde, trichloroethylene, and benzene. This research launched the plant
to superstardom in the houseplant world.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🐉 Dragon's Blood Connection">

The genus name "Dracaena" (dragon) comes from the red resin produced by some
species, known as "dragon's blood." While D. fragrans doesn't produce much
resin, its relatives like D. draco were historically important sources of this
valuable red pigment used in medicine, dyes, and varnishes.
