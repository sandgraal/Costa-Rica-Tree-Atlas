description: "The Guanábana Cimarrona (Mountain Soursop or Wild Guanábana) is a wild relative of the cultivated guanábana, producing medium-sized fruits with fibrous, acidic flesh. Native to Central and South America, this forest tree thrives in humid lowland areas and produces fruits that, while more sour and fibrous than the cultivated variety, are still used in beverages and traditional medicine. The Spanish name 'cimarrona' (wild/untamed) reflects its forest origins and less-domesticated character."

# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "moderate"
toxicParts:
  - "seeds"
  - "leaves"
  - "roots"
  - "bark"
skinContactRisk: "mild"
allergenRisk: "low"
structuralRisks: []
childSafe: false
petSafe: false
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "The SEEDS are HIGHLY TOXIC and must NEVER be consumed. Seeds contain high concentrations of annonacin and other acetogenins that are potently neurotoxic. Ingestion of seeds can cause severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and potentially serious neurological symptoms including tremors and altered consciousness. The FRUIT PULP is SAFE to eat when ALL seeds are completely removed—however, the pulp is very sour and fibrous, making it less palatable than cultivated guanábana. LEAVES contain the same neurotoxic compounds as seeds and should NOT be consumed except under expert guidance (traditional medicinal use of leaf tea has been associated with atypical Parkinsonism syndrome when consumed chronically). BARK and ROOTS also contain toxic alkaloids."
skinContactDetails: "Sap and leaf contact may cause mild skin irritation in sensitive individuals. Wash hands after handling leaves or bark. The fruit flesh is safe to handle."
allergenDetails: "Low risk of allergic reactions. Rare cases of oral allergy syndrome have been reported in individuals sensitized to other Annona species or tropical fruits. Contact dermatitis from sap is uncommon but possible."
structuralRiskDetails: "No structural risks. Tree has a relatively small stature and flexible branches that rarely break. Does not pose hazards to structures or people."
safetyNotes: "The fruit pulp is SAFE to eat after completely removing ALL seeds—but the taste is very sour/acidic and the texture is fibrous and grainy, making it less enjoyable than cultivated guanábana (*A. muricata*). Use in juice with added sugar or mix with sweeter fruits. NEVER eat seeds—they are poisonous. Do NOT use leaves medicinally without expert supervision. Traditional medicinal uses have risks. Pregnant and breastfeeding women should avoid consuming any parts except the seedless fruit pulp. The sap may cause mild skin irritation—avoid contact with eyes."
wildlifeRisks: "Seeds are toxic to most domestic animals including dogs, cats, birds, and livestock. Fruit pulp (completely seedless) is generally safe for wildlife. Wild animals (monkeys, bats, birds) safely consume and disperse seeds—but pets should not be allowed near fruits or seeds."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "moderate-to-fast"
growthRateDetails: "60-120 cm/year in good conditions; more vigorous than cultivated guanábana; begins fruiting at 3-4 years from seed"
matureSize: "5-12 m tall, crown spread 4-8 m - slightly larger than cultivated guanábana"
hardiness: "Tropical humid lowlands (0-1000m); more tolerant of wet conditions than A. muricata; sensitive to frost"
soilRequirements: "Adaptable to wide range of soils; tolerates heavy clay and poorly-drained soils better than A. muricata; prefers organic-rich, moist soils; pH 4.5-7.0"
waterNeeds: "moderate-to-high"
waterDetails: "Requires consistent moisture; more tolerant of wet conditions and waterlogging than cultivated guanábana. Water regularly during establishment. Mature trees tolerate brief flooding and very wet soils. Best growth in consistently moist, even waterlogged lowland sites. Drought stress reduces growth but tree recovers quickly after rains."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plant 5-8 m from buildings and other trees; larger and more spreading than cultivated guanábana"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
  - "grafting"
propagationDifficulty: "easy"
plantingSeason: "Rainy season (May-November) best for establishment; can plant year-round with adequate water"
maintenanceNeeds: "LOW maintenance—minimal care required. This is a tough, adaptable wild species. Water regularly during first 1-2 years for establishment. Fertilize 2-3 times annually with compost or balanced fertilizer for faster growth and better fruiting. Prune minimally—remove dead wood and crossing branches. Tree is relatively pest and disease resistant compared to cultivated guanábana. Hand pollination not usually necessary—good natural fruit set with beetle pollinators. Fruit ready when it softens slightly and falls from tree or can be twisted off with gentle pressure. Wild fruits are less prone to pest damage than cultivated varieties."
commonProblems:
  - "Fruit flies occasionally damage fruit - less problematic than with cultivated guanábana"
  - "Anthracnose in very humid conditions - ensure good air circulation"
  - "Scale insects on leaves - tolerated by tree, rarely requires treatment"
  - "Seeds spread easily - tree can become weedy in suitable conditions"

# Guanábana Cimarrona (Wild Soursop)

<Callout type="success" title="The Wild Cousin of Guanábana">
  The **Guanábana Cimarrona** (_Annona montana_), also called Wild Soursop or
  Mountain Guanábana, is the wild, untamed relative of the beloved cultivated
  guanábana (*A. muricata*). Native to the humid forests of Central and South
  America, this vigorous tree produces medium-sized yellowish fruits that, while
  edible, are significantly more sour, acidic, and fibrous than their cultivated
  cousin. The Spanish name "cimarrona" (from *cimarrón*, meaning "wild" or
  "untamed") reflects its forest origins and less-domesticated character. While
  not commonly cultivated for fruit, Guanábana Cimarrona is valued as a hardy
  shade tree, wildlife food source, and ingredient in traditional medicine and
  beverages where its extreme tartness can be balanced with sugar.

## Ecology and Habitat

### Forest Role

_Annona montana_ plays a role in humid tropical forest ecosystems as a mid-sized fruiting tree, though it is of less ecological importance than some other Annona species due to the poor palatability of its fruits.

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Ecological Functions

- **Wildlife food**: Fruits eaten by some monkeys, bats, birds despite sourness
- **Seed dispersal**: Large seeds dispersed by mammals and birds
- **Nectar source**: Flowers provide food for pollinators
- **Pioneer/edge species**: Colonizes disturbed areas and forest edges

</Column>
<Column>

#### Wildlife Interactions

**Pollinators**:

- Nitidulid beetles (primary pollinators)
- Other beetle species

**Seed Dispersers**:

- Howler monkeys (tolerate sour fruit)
- Capuchin monkeys
- Fruit-eating bats
- Large birds (toucans, oropendolas)
- Seeds sometimes spread by water (tree grows near streams)

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

### Reproductive Biology

Like other Annona species, _A. montana_ exhibits **protogyny** (female phase before male phase in flowers), promoting cross-pollination. However, fruit set is generally good without hand pollination, as beetle pollinators are usually abundant in forest environments.

### Soil and Water Relations

<DataTable
  headers={["Factor", "Preference", "Tolerance"]}
  rows={[
    ["Soil type", "Moist, organic-rich", "Wide range including heavy clay"],

<Callout type="success" title="Wet Site Advantage">
  Unlike cultivated guanábana (*A. muricata*), which prefers well-drained soils,
  *A. montana* TOLERATES wet, poorly-drained, even periodically flooded sites.
  This makes it suitable for swampy areas, riverbanks, and heavy clay soils
  where cultivated Annona species struggle.

## Traditional and Modern Uses

### Culinary Uses (Limited)

Due to its very sour, fibrous fruit, Guanábana Cimarrona is NOT a preferred fruit tree. However, it can be used:

<DataTable
  headers={["Preparation", "Description", "Notes"]}
  rows={[
    [
      "Fresh juice (heavily sweetened)",
      "Blended with water and lots of sugar/sweetener",
      "Makes a tart, refreshing drink—traditional use",
    ],
    [
      "Mixed fruit beverages",
      "Combined with sweeter fruits (banana, pineapple)",
      "Dilutes extreme sourness",
    ],
    [
      "Traditional fermented drinks",
      "Used in some indigenous preparations",
      "Rare; regional specialty",
    ],
    ["NOT for fresh eating", "Too sour and fibrous", "Not recommended"],
    [
      "NOT for ice cream/desserts",
      "Flavor and texture unsuitable",
      "Use *A. muricata* instead",
    ],
  ]}
/>

<FeatureBox title="Preparing Guanábana Cimarrona Juice" icon="🥤">
  If you want to try making juice from wild Guanábana Cimarrona fruit (for curiosity or when nothing else is available):

1. Wait for fruit to soften and fall from tree (ripe when slightly soft)
2. Cut fruit open and scoop out flesh into bowl
3. **CRITICAL**: Remove and discard ALL seeds—they are TOXIC
4. Add 3-4 parts water to 1 part pulp
5. Blend well (helps break down fibers)
6. Strain through fine mesh or cheesecloth to remove fibers
7. Add LOTS of sugar or other sweetener(expect to use 2-3x as much as with cultivated guanábana)
8. Optionally mix with other sweeter fruit juices (pineapple, mango)
9. Serve chilled

**Result**: A tart, astringent juice with medicinal/herbal undertones—an acquired taste, not a crowd-pleaser like cultivated guanábana juice.

</FeatureBox>

### Traditional Medicine

_Annona montana_ has been used in traditional medicine systems, particularly in indigenous and rural communities. However, scientific validation is limited and risks are significant.

<Callout type="danger" title="Traditional Medicinal Use—SERIOUS RISKS">
  **CAUTION**: All parts of *Annona montana* except the fruit pulp (seeds removed) contain toxic compounds (acetogenins, alkaloids).

**Traditionaluses (NOT recommended without expert supervision)**:

- **Leaf tea**: Consumed for digestive issues, infections, inflammation (contains neurotoxic compounds—chronic use linked to Parkinson-like syndrome)
- **Bark decoction**: Used externally for skin infections (internal use dangerous)
- **Crushed seeds**: Applied externally as insecticide, lice treatment (NEVER ingest—highly toxic)
- **Root preparations**: Rarely used; very toxic

**IMPORTANT**: Modern medicine offers safer alternatives for all conditions traditionally treated with Annona preparations. Do NOT self-medicate with Guanábana Cimarrona. The neurotoxic acetogenins accumulate in the brain and may cause irreversible damage with chronic use.

</Callout>

### Modern Research Interest

Research on _Annona montana_ focuses on:

- **Acetogenin compounds**: Leaves, bark, and seeds contain Annonaceous acetogenins with potential anticancer properties (laboratory studies only—NOT safe for human consumption)
- **Antimicrobial activity**: Extracts show activity against bacteria and fungi
- **Neurotoxicity concerns**: Chronic consumption of Annona extracts linked to atypical Parkinsonism in some populations
- **Comparison with _A. muricata_**: Differences in chemical profiles and toxicity

## Growing Guide

### Is Guanábana Cimarrona Right for You?

<Callout type="info" title="Consider Your Goals">
  **Good reasons to plant Guanábana Cimarrona**:

✅ You want a hardy, fast-growing shade tree  
✅ You need a tree that tolerates wet, poorly-drained soils  
✅ You want wildlife food (even if fruit is sour)  
✅ You're interested in traditional medicine (expert guidance required)  
✅ You want a living fence or windbreak  
✅ You're curious about wild tropical fruits

❌ **DON'T plant this tree if**: You want delicious fresh fruit (plant _A. muricata_ or _A. reticulata_ instead), you have limited space (tree is large and vigorous), or you don't want seedlings spreading (fruits drop and seeds sprout readily).

  </Callout>

### Propagation

**From Seed (Easy and Common)**

1. Collect seeds from ripe fruit (soft, yellowish)
2. Clean pulp from seeds
3. Plant fresh (within 1-2 weeks) in moist, well-draining medium
4. Plant 1-2 cm deep
5. Keep warm (25-30°C) and moist
6. **Germination**: 2-4 weeks (fast and reliable)
7. Transplant seedlings when 20-30 cm tall

**Grafting** (uncommon but possible onto _A. muricata_ or _A. glabra_ rootstock)

### Site Selection and Planting

- **Climate**: Warm, humid tropical lowlands (0-1000m)
- **Light**: Full sun to partial shade
- **Soil**: Adaptable—clay, loam, sandy; tolerates wet soils
- **Spacing**: 6-8 m from structures and other trees
- **Planting time**: Rainy season (May-November) best

**Planting steps**: Dig hole 50x50x50 cm, add compost, plant at same depth as pot, water deeply, mulch.

### Care and Maintenance

**Watering**: Regular watering first 1-2 years; mature trees drought-tolerant but prefer consistent moisture

**Fertilization**: Optional—tree grows well without fertilizer. Apply compost 2-3x/year for faster growth.

**Pruning**: Minimal—remove dead wood and shape if desired

**Pests/Diseases**: Generally pest-resistant; occasional scale insects

### Harvesting

Fruits ripen June-November. Harvest when fruit softens and falls from tree or twists off easily. Fruit does not ripen well off tree—wait for full ripeness.

## Agroforestry Applications

_Annona montana_ is occasionally used in agroforestry:

- **Shade tree for coffee and cacao**: Medium-sized tree provides moderate shade
- **Living fences and property borders**: Dense growth, multiple stems, thorny relatives nearby
- **Wildlife corridors**: Fruits eaten by forest animals
- **Wet site pioneer**: Establishes quickly in swampy,problem areas

Good companions: Coffee, cacao, banana, Inga species

<Callout type="warning">
  If you want fruit for eating, choose *A. muricata* (cultivated guanábana). It
  is sweeter, creamier, and far more delicious. Choose *A. montana* (cimarrona)
  only if you need a hardy shade tree for wet sites or are interested in wild
  tropical fruits.

## Where to Find Guanábana Cimarrona in Costa Rica

_Annona montana_ is not commonly cultivated but can be found in wild and semi-wild areas:

### Wild/Natural Areas

- **Caribbean lowlands (Limón, Talamanca)**: Common in humid forests, forest edges, riverbanks
- **Osa Peninsula (Puntarenas)**: Occasionally in wet forests
- **San Carlos lowlands (Alajuela)**: Occasional along rivers and wetland edges
- **Protected areas**: Tortuguero, Braulio Carrillo, Corcov ado (wild populations)

### Cultivated/Semi-Cultivated

- **Rural properties in wet regions**: Occasionally planted as shade tree
- **Local markets**: RARE—not comercially sold; might find in Caribbean market towns during season
- **Botanical collections**: CATIE (Turrialba), university collections may have specimens

<Callout type="tip">
  If you're interested in seeing or tasting Guanábana Cimarrona, ask farmers in
  the Caribbean lowlands (Limón, Talamanca) or San Carlos. Many know where wild
  trees grow. Be prepared for extreme sourness—it's an acquired taste!

## Cultural Significance

_Annona montana_ is less culturally significant than cultivated Annona species, but it has local importance:

- **Indigenous knowledge**: Used by indigenous groups for medicine and occasional food
- **Rural communities**: Known to farmers and forest workers as "guanábana de monte" (forest guanábana)
- **Traditional beverages**: Occasionally used in homemade drinks with sweetening
- **Not commercially popular**: Its poor flavor limits cultural prominence

## Summary

<Callout type="success" title="Key Takeaways: Guanábana Cimarrona">
  **Identification**: Wild relative of guanábana with smaller (15-20 cm), yellowish fruits that are **very sour, fibrous, and unpalatable** compared to cultivated guanábana.

**Ecology**: Native to wet tropical lowlands (0-1000m) of Central and South America; tolerates wet, poorly-drained soils better than cultivated Annona species.

**Uses**: Limited culinary use (very sour juice with heavy sweetening); traditional medicine (risks significant); better suited as shade tree, wildlife food, living fence.

**Cultivation**: Easy to grow from seed; fast-growing, vigorous, low-maintenance. Tolerates wet conditions. NOT recommended for fruit production—plant _A. muricata_ instead for eating.

**Safety**: Seeds TOXIC—never consume. Leaves and bark contain neurotoxic compounds. Fruit flesh safe but very sour.

**Why grow it?**: Hardy shade tree for wet sites; wildlife food source; curiosity/wild fruit research; traditional medicine (expert use only). NOT for delicious fruit.
