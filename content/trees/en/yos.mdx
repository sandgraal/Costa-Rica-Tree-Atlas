toxicityDetails: "Yos is in Euphorbiaceae (spurge family) and contains TOXIC LATEX. The milky white sap is irritating and mildly toxic if ingested - causes burning sensation in mouth, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Indigenous peoples historically used the latex as fish poison, indicating toxicity to aquatic life and general toxicity. All parts contain some level of toxic compounds. While not as dangerous as some Euphorbiaceae members, the tree should not be planted where children or pets might contact broken branches or leaves. The latex flows freely when any part is damaged."
skinContactDetails: "MODERATE skin irritation risk. The latex can cause contact dermatitis, redness, itching, and burning sensation on skin. Some individuals develop allergic reactions. Eye contact is particularly problematic - causes burning and irritation. Wash immediately with soap and water if exposed. Avoid touching eyes after handling the tree."
allergenDetails: "Some individuals may develop allergic contact dermatitis from repeated exposure to the latex."
safetyNotes: "Use caution with this tree. While it's ecologically important as a pioneer species and wildlife food source, the toxic latex makes it unsuitable for high-traffic areas, schools, or playgrounds. Warn children not to break branches or handle sap. The tree is valuable in reforestation but should be planted away from areas where people or pets frequently pass. Birds safely eat the seeds without issue (seeds pass through digestive system)."
wildlifeRisks: "TOXIC latex is harmful if pets ingest leaves or bark. Keep dogs and cats away from this tree. Birds eat the seeds safely. The historical use as fish poison indicates toxicity to aquatic life - do not plant near streams or ponds where latex runoff could occur."

# Yos

<Callout type="info" title="The Milkwood Pioneer">
  **Yos** (_Sapium glandulosum_), also known as Leche de Vaca or Milkwood, is
  one of Costa Rica's most successful pioneer trees. Easily recognized by the
  distinctive glands at the top of its leaf stalks and the abundant milky latex
  that flows when any part is cut, this fast-growing species colonizes disturbed
  areas and provides critical food resources for wildlife. While it may not be
  the most glamorous rainforest tree, Yos is an ecological workhorse—one of the
  first trees to appear after disturbance and a favorite of seed-eating birds
  across its range.

### Identifying Features

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### The Diagnostic Glands

- **Location**: Top of leaf stalk (petiole)
- **Number**: Usually 2 prominent glands
- **Color**: Often reddish or dark
- **Function**: Attract ants (extrafloral nectaries)
- **Key ID**: Most diagnostic feature!
- **Visible**: Easy to see on fresh leaves

#### Latex

- **Color**: White, milky
- **Flow**: Abundant, quick
- **Consistency**: Thick, sticky
- **Warning**: Caustic—can irritate skin/eyes

</Column>
<Column>

#### Leaves

- **Arrangement**: Alternate, simple
- **Shape**: Elliptic to ovate
- **Size**: 8-15 cm long
- **Margin**: Finely serrated
- **Tip**: Pointed (acuminate)
- **Texture**: Somewhat leathery

#### Flowers and Fruit

- **Flowers**: Small, greenish, in terminal spikes
- **Fruit**: 3-lobed capsule, ~1.5 cm
- **Seeds**: Dark, 3 per capsule
- **Dehiscence**: Explosive, loud cracking
- **Season**: Mainly rainy season

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

<Callout type="warning" title="Caustic Latex: Handle with Care">
  Like many Euphorbiaceae, Yos produces copious **milky latex** that can cause
  serious irritation: **Cautions**: - **Skin**: Can cause rashes, burning -
  **Eyes**: VERY dangerous—can cause temporary blindness - **Mouth**: Highly
  toxic if ingested **If Exposed**: - Wash thoroughly with soap and water - For
  eyes, flush with clean water, seek medical help - Never burn branches near
  face (latex vaporizes) **Working Safely**: - Wear gloves when handling cut
  branches - Keep away from face when cutting - Avoid during hot weather (latex
  more fluid) The latex is a defense mechanism against herbivores—effective!

## Ecological Role

### Pioneer Powerhouse

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Succession Role

- **Early colonizer**: Among first trees after disturbance
- **Fast growth**: Rapid establishment
- **Gap specialist**: Thrives in forest openings
- **Nurse species**: Provides shade for slower species
- **Nitrogen indifferent**: Establishes on poor soils

</Column>
<Column>

#### Wildlife Value

- **Seed-eating birds**: Major food source
- **Oropendolas**: Favorite food
- **Parrots and parakeets**: Consume seeds
- **Small mammals**: Eat fallen seeds
- **Ants**: Attracted to petiole glands

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

<Callout type="success" title="Bird Magnet Extraordinaire">
  Yos is one of the most important food sources for seed-eating birds in Costa
  Rica: **Why Birds Love Yos**: - Seeds rich in oils and proteins - Abundant
  fruit production - Predictable fruiting season - Accessible seed arrangement
  **Regular Visitors**: - **Oropendolas** (Montezuma, Chestnut-headed) -
  **Parakeets** (several species) - **Toucans** (occasionally) - **Tanagers** -
  **Saltators** - **Various finches** **Fruiting Spectacle**: When a Yos is in
  fruit, watch for mixed flocks gathering— sometimes dozens of birds feeding
  together! This makes Yos valuable for birdwatching locations and wildlife
  corridors.
</Callout>

### Ant-Plant Relationship

<FeatureBox title="Extrafloral Nectaries" icon="🐜">
  Those distinctive glands at the top of the leaf stalks aren't just for
  identification—they're **extrafloral nectaries**: **How They Work**: - Glands
  produce sugary nectar - Ants feed on the nectar - Ants patrol the plant - Ants
  attack herbivorous insects **Mutual Benefits**: - Plant: Gets protection from
  herbivores - Ants: Get reliable food source - Neither can thrive as well alone
  **Observable**: Look closely at Yos leaves and you'll often see ants visiting
  the petiole glands—a mutualism in action!

## Cultivation

### Growing Yos

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Site Selection">
    **Suitable Conditions**: - Full sun to partial shade - Any reasonably
    drained soil - Wide elevation range - Tolerates seasonally dry conditions
    **Best For**: - Forest restoration projects - Wildlife gardens - Living
    fences - Erosion control on slopes

<Callout type="success" title="The Humble Workhorse">
  In a country famous for towering emergents, magnificent buttresses, and rare
  hardwoods, the Yos might seem unremarkable—a common tree found along every
  road and forest edge. Yet this milkwood pioneer is one of the unsung heroes of
  Costa Rica's forests. When a tree falls, when land is abandoned, when a gap
  opens in the canopy, Yos is among the first to arrive, quickly establishing
  and beginning the slow process of forest recovery. Its branches become feeding
  stations for dozens of bird species, its petiole glands sustain armies of
  protective ants, and its shade nurtures the seedlings of slower-growing
  species that will eventually overtake it. Every forest has to start somewhere,
  and more often than not, that somewhere includes Yos. Next time you pass by
  one of these common trees, take a moment to check those characteristic glands
  on the leaf stalks, maybe watch for a moment as birds feast on its seeds, and
  appreciate this humble workhorse of tropical forest succession.
