# Aguacatillo (Wild Avocado)

<Callout type="success" title="The Quetzal's Lifeline">
  The **Aguacatillo** (_Persea caerulea_) is perhaps the most ecologically
  important tree in Costa Rica's cloud forests. Its small, avocado-like fruits
  are the primary food source for the **Resplendent Quetzal**, one of the
  world's most beautiful and culturally significant birds. The tree's fruiting
  season directly influences quetzal breeding success and migration patterns.

## Physical Description

### Overall Form

The Aguacatillo is a medium to large evergreen tree with a dense, rounded crown. Its thick, leathery leaves have a characteristic bluish-green color, and the bark is grayish-brown with shallow fissures. The tree often develops a straight trunk with spreading branches that create important habitat structure in cloud forests.

## Ecological Importance

### The Quetzal Connection

<Callout type="warning" title="Critical Wildlife Relationship">
  The relationship between Aguacatillo trees and Resplendent Quetzals is one of
  the most important plant-animal interactions in Central American cloud
  forests. Quetzals are one of the few birds capable of swallowing the fruits
  whole and are crucial seed dispersers.
</Callout>

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Why Quetzals Need This Tree

- **Primary food source** during breeding season
- **High fat content** (40%+) provides energy for nesting
- **Fruit size** perfectly matches quetzal gape
- **Fruiting timing** aligns with quetzal breeding

</Column>
<Column>

#### Seed Dispersal Services

- Quetzals regurgitate seeds intact
- Seeds dispersed far from parent tree
- High germination rates after gut passage
- Creates forest connectivity

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

### Cloud Forest Ecosystem Role

The Aguacatillo is a keystone species in Costa Rican cloud forests:

- **Food web anchor**: Supports dozens of bird species
- **Watershed protection**: Deep roots stabilize steep slopes
- **Carbon storage**: Long-lived trees accumulate carbon
- **Microhabitat creation**: Epiphytes cover branches

---

## Distribution in Costa Rica

<Callout type="info" title="Where to Find It">
  The Aguacatillo is found throughout Costa Rica's highland cloud forests,
  primarily between 1,200 and 3,000 meters elevation. Key locations include
  Monteverde, the Central Volcanic Range, and the Talamanca Mountains.
</Callout>

## Conservation Status

### Current Status

<Callout type="success" title="Least Concern (IUCN)">
  While the species itself is not threatened, habitat loss and climate change
  pose significant risks to cloud forest ecosystems where Aguacatillo thrives.
</Callout>

### Conservation Concerns

- **Climate change**: Cloud forests shifting upward in elevation
- **Deforestation**: Loss of forest connectivity
- **Agricultural expansion**: Pressure on forest edges
- **Fragmentation**: Isolated populations

### Protection Efforts

Costa Rica protects significant Aguacatillo populations through:

- National parks (Los Quetzales, Chirripó, Braulio Carrillo)
- Private reserves (Monteverde, Savegre)
- Biological corridors connecting highlands
- Reforestation programs

## Interesting Facts

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="🦜 The Quetzal's Favorite">

The Resplendent Quetzal can eat up to **50 Aguacatillo fruits per day** during
the breeding season. The birds hover briefly while plucking fruits, then
swallow them whole. After digesting the oily flesh, they regurgitate the large
seeds, often while perched on different trees, effectively planting new
Aguacatillos throughout the forest.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🌿 Aromatic Relative">

Like its famous cousin the avocado, Aguacatillo belongs to the laurel family,
which includes cinnamon, bay laurel, and sassafras. Crushing the leaves releases
aromatic oils with a distinctive fragrance—a family trait shared across this
ancient lineage of plants.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="📊 Nutritional Powerhouse">

Aguacatillo fruits contain up to **40% fat by dry weight**, making them one of
the most energy-dense wild fruits in the cloud forest. This high caloric content
is essential for fueling the energetically demanding breeding behaviors of
quetzals and other frugivorous birds.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🌡️ Climate Indicator">

Scientists use Aguacatillo distribution to track climate change impacts on cloud
forests. As temperatures warm, the trees are expected to shift to higher
elevations, potentially creating "summit traps" where species run out of suitable
habitat—a major concern for both the tree and the quetzals that depend on it.
