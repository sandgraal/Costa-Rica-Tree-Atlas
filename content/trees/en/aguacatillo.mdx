toxicityDetails: "Aguacatillo is a member of the Lauraceae (avocado family) and contains persin, the same compound found in cultivated avocados. The fruit is small and mostly consumed by wildlife (especially quetzals). While not typically eaten by humans (too small, mostly pit), it poses minimal risk to people. However, like all avocado relatives, it contains persin which is TOXIC TO PETS (dogs, cats, birds, horses) and can cause vomiting, diarrhea, heart damage, and respiratory distress in animals."
skinContactDetails: "No skin irritation. Safe to handle leaves, bark, and fruit."
allergenDetails: "Some individuals may have mild allergic reactions to Lauraceae family members, but this is uncommon."
safetyNotes: "Safe for children and human interaction. The small fruits are not palatable to humans and are left for wildlife. Plant this tree if you want to attract quetzals to your property. However, DO NOT plant near areas where pets frequent, particularly dogs and cats. Keep fallen fruit away from domestic animals."
wildlifeRisks: "TOXIC TO PETS - particularly dogs, cats, birds, and horses due to persin content. Can cause vomiting, diarrhea, respiratory distress, and heart problems in domestic animals. Keep pets away from fallen fruit. Ironically, wild birds including quetzals have evolved to safely consume these fruits, making this tree critical wildlife habitat while being dangerous to domestic animals."

## Habitat & Growing Conditions

<PropertiesGrid>
  <PropertyCard title="Elevation Range" value="1,200–3,000 m" />
  <PropertyCard title="Annual Rainfall" value="2,000–4,000 mm" />
  <PropertyCard title="Temperature" value="10–20°C" />

  <PropertyCard title="Light" value="Partial shade to full sun" />
  <PropertyCard title="Humidity" value="80–100% (cloud immersion)" />
</PropertiesGrid>

The Aguacatillo thrives in the misty conditions of tropical montane cloud forests. These forests are characterized by near-constant cloud cover, high humidity, and cool temperatures. The trees can tolerate occasional frost at higher elevations and are well adapted to waterlogged soils common on cloud forest ridges.

In Costa Rica, cloud forests occupy only about 1% of the national territory but harbor a disproportionate share of biodiversity. The Aguacatillo is one of the most common canopy trees in these ecosystems, often growing alongside oaks (_Quercus costaricensis_), magnolias, and tree ferns.

---

## Distribution in Costa Rica

<Callout type="info" title="Where to Find It">
  The Aguacatillo is found throughout Costa Rica's highland cloud forests,
  primarily between 1,200 and 3,000 meters elevation. Key locations include
  Monteverde, the Central Volcanic Range, and the Talamanca Mountains.

## Cultural Significance

### Indigenous Heritage

The Aguacatillo holds deep cultural importance in Costa Rica's highland communities. The Cabécar and Bribri peoples of the Talamanca range have long recognized this tree as a guardian of the cloud forest. In traditional cosmology, the Aguacatillo is seen as a bridge between the terrestrial and spiritual worlds—its branches reaching into the perpetual mist that veils the mountains. The indigenous name "Yas" is still used in parts of the Central Valley and reflects pre-Columbian knowledge of the tree's ecological role.

Before European contact, indigenous communities used the Aguacatillo's aromatic bark and leaves in ceremonial preparations. The oils extracted from its fruits and leaves were valued for medicinal purposes, and the wood was used selectively for tools and construction elements that needed to resist moisture. This traditional ecological knowledge anticipated by centuries what modern science now confirms: the tree is a keystone species essential to cloud forest health.

### The Quetzal and National Identity

The relationship between the Aguacatillo and the Resplendent Quetzal has become a powerful symbol of Costa Rica's conservation ethos. The quetzal—revered by the Maya and Aztec civilizations as a representation of the god Quetzalcoatl—depends on this humble tree for survival. Costa Rica's successful protection of quetzal habitat, including Aguacatillo forests, is celebrated as one of the country's greatest conservation achievements. The Savegre Valley, one of the world's best quetzal-watching destinations, owes much of its tourism economy to the Aguacatillo trees that draw these magnificent birds.

### Ecotourism and Local Economy

## Wood Properties

While the Aguacatillo is primarily valued for its ecological role rather than its timber, the wood does have local uses:

<PropertiesGrid>
  <PropertyCard title="Heartwood Color" value="Light brown to reddish-brown" />
  <PropertyCard title="Sapwood Color" value="Cream to pale yellow" />
  <PropertyCard title="Density" value="Moderate (0.45–0.55 g/cm³)" />
  <PropertyCard title="Workability" value="Easy to work" />
  <PropertyCard title="Durability" value="Low to moderate" />
  <PropertyCard title="Grain" value="Straight to slightly interlocked" />
</PropertiesGrid>

The wood is soft to moderately hard, with a fine, even texture. It is not commercially traded as timber but is used locally in highland communities for:

- **Rural construction**: Fence posts, house beams (where naturally available)
- **Firewood**: Burns slowly with pleasant aromatic smoke
- **Crafts**: Carved utensils and small tools
- **Essential oils**: Bark and wood distilled for aromatic compounds

<Callout type="warning" title="Conservation Note">
  Harvesting Aguacatillo for timber is not recommended and is restricted in many
  protected areas. The tree's ecological value as quetzal habitat far exceeds
  any timber value. Sustainable alternatives should always be preferred.

## Interesting Facts

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="🦜 The Quetzal's Favorite">

The Resplendent Quetzal can eat up to **50 Aguacatillo fruits per day** during
the breeding season. The birds hover briefly while plucking fruits, then
swallow them whole. After digesting the oily flesh, they regurgitate the large
seeds, often while perched on different trees, effectively planting new
Aguacatillos throughout the forest.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🌿 Aromatic Relative">

Like its famous cousin the avocado, Aguacatillo belongs to the laurel family,
which includes cinnamon, bay laurel, and sassafras. Crushing the leaves releases
aromatic oils with a distinctive fragrance—a family trait shared across this
ancient lineage of plants.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="📊 Nutritional Powerhouse">

Aguacatillo fruits contain up to **40% fat by dry weight**, making them one of
the most energy-dense wild fruits in the cloud forest. This high caloric content
is essential for fueling the energetically demanding breeding behaviors of
quetzals and other frugivorous birds.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🌡️ Climate Indicator">

Scientists use Aguacatillo distribution to track climate change impacts on cloud
forests. As temperatures warm, the trees are expected to shift to higher
elevations, potentially creating "summit traps" where species run out of suitable
habitat—a major concern for both the tree and the quetzals that depend on it.

_The Aguacatillo (Persea caerulea) stands as a silent pillar of cloud forest ecology—a tree whose existence is inextricably linked to the Resplendent Quetzal and the health of Costa Rica's highland ecosystems. Every fruit it produces sustains the birds that captivate visitors from around the world, and every seed those birds disperse plants the next generation of forest. To protect the quetzal, we must protect the Aguacatillo._
