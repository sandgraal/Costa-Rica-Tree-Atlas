# Rambutan

<Callout type="info" title="The Hairy Fruit Tree">
  The **Rambutan** (_Nephelium lappaceum_) is one of the most visually striking
  and delicious tropical fruits in the world. Native to Southeast Asia and
  closely related to lychee and longan, this evergreen tree produces clusters of
  golf ball-sized fruits covered in soft, hair-like spines—giving rise to its
  name from the Malay word _rambut_ meaning "hair." Beneath this exotic exterior
  lies translucent, grape-like flesh that has made rambutan increasingly popular
  in Costa Rica's humid lowlands, where it has found an ideal second home in the
  Caribbean and Central Valley regions.

## Ecological Significance

### Pollinator Relationships

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Primary Pollinators

Rambutan flowers are highly attractive to bees due to their abundant nectar production:

- **Honey bees** (_Apis dorsata_, _A. cerana_): Primary pollinators
- **Stingless bees** (_Trigona_ spp.): Important in Southeast Asia
- **Various flies** (Diptera): Secondary pollinators
- **Ants** (_Solenopsis_ spp.): Incidental pollinators

Female flowers produce 2-3× more nectar than male flowers, attracting more pollinator visits.

</Column>
<Column>

#### Pollination Requirements

- **Cross-pollination** is essential for most cultivars
- Commercial varieties are hermaphroditic but require pollinators
- Only ~1% of female flowers set fruit under natural conditions
- Hand pollination can achieve 13% fruit set
- Adequate bee populations crucial for commercial production
- In Costa Rica, native stingless bees supplement honey bees

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

### Wildlife Value

<SimpleList
  items={[
    "Birds: Attracted to ripe fruit; assist in seed dispersal",
    "Bats: May visit flowers for nectar in native range",
    "Primates: Important fruit consumers in Southeast Asian forests",
    "Bees: Valuable nectar source; produces significant honey",

### Common Problems

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Climate Limitations" defaultOpen={true}>
    Rambutan is strictly a humid tropical lowland tree:
    - **Frost**: Any frost kills the tree; young growth damaged at 4°C
    - **Altitude**: Production drops significantly above 600m
    - **Dry periods**: More than 2-3 dry months reduces yields
    - **Wind**: Damages branches and knocks off developing fruit

    **Solution**: Only plant in suitable humid lowland locations with wind protection.

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Short Shelf Life">
    Fresh rambutan fruit deteriorates rapidly:
    - Shelf life only a few days after harvest
    - Spines and skin turn black quickly
    - Weight loss from transpiration
    - Fruit doesn't ripen after picking

    **Solution**: Harvest at optimal ripeness, keep moist and shaded, transport quickly to market.

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Pollination Issues">
    Poor fruit set is common:
    - Only ~1% of female flowers naturally set fruit
    - Requires cross-pollination
    - Inadequate bee populations reduce yields
    - Weather affects pollinator activity

    **Solution**: Maintain healthy bee populations, consider managed hives during flowering.

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Long Juvenile Period">
    Seedling trees take years to fruit:
    - 6-8 years from seed to first fruit
    - Unpredictable fruit quality from seeds
    - Long wait for return on investment

    **Solution**: Use grafted or air-layered plants which fruit in 2-3 years with guaranteed quality.
