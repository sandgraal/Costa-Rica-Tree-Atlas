# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "none"
toxicParts: []
skinContactRisk: "low"
allergenRisk: "high"
structuralRisks: []
childSafe: true
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "The living tree, leaves, flowers, and seeds are NON-TOXIC to humans and animals. Safe for planting in residential areas, parks, and gardens where children and pets are present. No ingestion toxicity concerns. The tree itself poses no poisoning hazard. As a nitrogen-fixing legume (Fabaceae family), it improves soil health safely."
skinContactDetails: "Direct contact with the living tree (leaves, bark, flowers) is safe for most people with minimal irritation risk. However, WOOD DUST can cause dermatitis and allergic skin reactions in woodworkers and sensitive individuals. Fresh sawdust may irritate skin upon contact. Overall, casual contact with the living tree is very low risk, but wood dust requires precautions."
allergenDetails: "Cristóbal wood dust is a SERIOUS RESPIRATORY SENSITIZER and HIGH allergen for woodworkers. Grouped with rosewoods (Dalbergia family) in toxicity, Platymiscium species cause: respiratory sensitization (allergic asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis), eye and skin irritation, dermatitis, and systemic effects (malaise, flu-like symptoms) with prolonged exposure. CRITICAL: Reactions WORSEN with repeated exposure - sensitization develops over time and can become SEVERE or even LIFE-THREATENING for some individuals. Once sensitized, symptoms intensify with each subsequent exposure. OSHA and occupational health agencies emphasize ALL wood dust is hazardous for chronic lung damage and cancer risk. MANDATORY SAFETY: Use dust extraction systems, P100 respirators, eye protection, gloves, covered skin. Maintain excellent workshop ventilation. Even hobbyists MUST adopt professional safety protocols. Finished, sealed wood products pose minimal risk to end users."
safetyNotes: "The LIVING TREE is completely safe for landscapes, parks, and gardens - no concerns for children or pets playing nearby. The SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN is for WOODWORKERS: Cristóbal is among the most allergenic tropical hardwoods due to rosewood-like properties. Professional carpenters, furniture makers, musical instrument builders, and hobbyists MUST use comprehensive dust protection from the FIRST cut. Individual sensitivity varies - some workers tolerate it while others develop severe, chronic respiratory disease. Because reactions worsen with exposure and can become permanently disabling, PREVENTION is essential. Never work without proper respiratory protection. Clean sawdust thoroughly, wash exposed skin/hair after sessions, and monitor for early symptoms (coughing, wheezing, skin rash). Seek medical attention if symptoms develop. Finished Cristóbal furniture and instruments are safe for homes and users."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "moderate"
growthRateDetails: "Moderate growth; 0.5-0.8 m/year in good conditions; reaches 10-12 m in 15-20 years; achieves mature timber size (25-30 m) in 40-60 years; slow to reach harvestable diameter; nitrogen-fixing accelerates growth"
matureSize: "25-40 m tall, trunk diameter 60-100 cm; crown spread 15-20 m; emergent canopy layer in mature forests; impressive stature at maturity"
hardiness: "Tropical lowlands to lower montane zones; Costa Rica elevation 0-1000m; thrives in Pacific slope dry forests and transitional zones; tolerates heat to 38°C; requires distinct dry season; no frost tolerance"
soilRequirements: "Prefers deep, well-drained fertile soils; tolerates poor to moderately fertile soils; pH 5.5-7.0; performs best on volcanic and alluvial soils; nitrogen-fixing improves degraded soils; does NOT tolerate waterlogged conditions; grows on hillsides and valleys"
waterNeeds: "moderate"
waterDetails: "MODERATE water needs with good drought tolerance once established. Young trees (years 1-3) need regular watering during dry season (weekly). Mature trees are moderately drought-tolerant and thrive with natural rainfall (1500-2500 mm annual). Prefers areas with distinct dry season (December-April). Can withstand 3-4 month dry periods. Supplemental irrigation beneficial during establishment only."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plant 8-12 m apart for timber production; 12-15 m spacing for specimen/shade trees; needs generous space for crown development"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
  - "cuttings"
propagationDifficulty: "moderate"
plantingSeason: "Plant at start of rainy season (May-June) for best establishment; seeds germinate in 2-4 weeks; scarify hard seed coat for better germination"
maintenanceNeeds: "LOW to MODERATE maintenance - suitable for timber plantations and reforestation. Years 1-3: water weekly during dry season, weed control critical, protect from livestock, stake if needed. Years 4-10: minimal care, prune lower branches for straight trunk (timber), no fertilizer needed (nitrogen-fixing). Years 11-40: essentially maintenance-free, allow natural development, periodic thinning in plantations. Near-Term Conservation Status (NT) - harvest sustainably. Self-sufficient legume, excellent for degraded land restoration."
commonProblems:
  - "Very few problems - resilient legume"
  - "Slow growth to harvestable size (40-60 years) - patience required"
  - "Seed pod beetles can damage seeds before collection"
  - "Young seedlings vulnerable to browsing by livestock/wildlife"
  - "WOOD DUST ALLERGEN - serious concern for woodworkers only"
  - "Near Threatened conservation status - plant sustainably"
  - "Limited commercial seed availability"
  - "Occasional defoliation by caterpillars - tree recovers"
  - "No serious pests or diseases commonly reported"
