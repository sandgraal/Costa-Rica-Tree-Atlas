# Espavel

<Callout type="tip" title="Giant of the Riverbank">
  The **Espavel** (_Anacardium excelsum_), also known as Wild Cashew or
  Caracolí, is one of Costa Rica's most impressive riparian trees. Towering up
  to 50 meters with massive buttress roots, this close relative of the
  commercial cashew produces edible nuts that are a crucial food source for
  wildlife throughout the tropical lowlands. Its preference for riverbanks makes
  it a keystone species for watershed health.

<Callout type="info" title="The Wild Cashew">
  The Espavel belongs to the same genus as the commercial cashew (_Anacardium
  occidentale_). Both species share the distinctive fruit structure with the
  "cashew apple" (swollen fruit stalk) and the kidney-shaped nut. While the
  commercial cashew originated in northeastern Brazil, the Espavel evolved as a
  forest giant of Central American riparian zones.

## Ecological Significance

### Riparian Keystone Species

<Callout type="success" title="Guardian of Waterways">
  The Espavel is a **keystone species** in riparian ecosystems. Its massive
  buttress roots stabilize riverbanks, preventing erosion. Its abundant fruit
  production during the dry season provides critical food for wildlife when
  other resources are scarce. The deep shade it casts helps keep streams cool
  for aquatic life.
</Callout>

### Wildlife Interactions

#### Other Wildlife

- **Bats**: Consume cashew apple portion
- **Parrots**: Feed on nuts
- **Fish**: Consume fallen fruits in flooded areas
- **Coatis**: Forage for fallen fruits
- **Peccaries**: Major consumers of fallen fruits
- **Many birds**: Utilize massive canopy for nesting

## Cultural & Economic Importance

### Traditional Uses

<FeatureBox title="The Wild Cashew Nut" icon="🥜">
  While smaller than commercial cashews, Espavel nuts have been harvested by
  indigenous peoples and rural communities for millennia. The nuts must be
  **carefully roasted** to destroy the urushiol compounds in the shell. Properly
  prepared, they have a rich, slightly smoky flavor prized in traditional
  cuisine. The "cashew apple" is also edible and can be made into beverages.

  ]}
/>

### Conservation Concerns

<Callout type="warning" title="Habitat Loss">
  While globally Least Concern, Espavel populations have declined significantly
  in Costa Rica due to: - **Riparian deforestation** for agriculture - **River
  channelization** and development - **Dam construction** flooding habitat -
  **Overharvest** of large specimens for timber The species is increasingly
  protected through watershed conservation programs, but historical losses have
  been substantial.

  young, kapok fruits | | _Anacardium occidentale_ | Smaller tree, coastal
  habitat | | _Brosimum alicastrum_ | Milky latex, different leaf shape | |
  _Ficus_ species | Aerial roots, different fruit type | The combination of
  massive buttresses, cashew-type fruits, and riparian habitat is diagnostic.
</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Seasonal Recognition">
    **Dry Season (December-April):** Brief leaf drop, conspicuous fruiting with
    yellow-orange "cashew apples" **Early Wet Season (May-June):** Fresh leaf
    flush, bright green new growth **Wet Season (July-November):** Full dark

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Time to See Espavel">
  Visit Costa Rica's lowland wet forests between **December and March** to see
  Espavel trees in their fruiting glory. The yellow-orange "cashew apples" are
  highly visible, and wildlife activity around fruiting trees is exceptional.
  Look for troops of capuchin monkeys, agoutis below the trees, and scarlet
  macaws feeding in the canopy. Tortuguero and Corcovado offer the best
  opportunities to see these magnificent giants in pristine riparian habitat.
