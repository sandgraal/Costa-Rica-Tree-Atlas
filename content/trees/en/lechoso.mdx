# Lechoso

<Callout type="success" title="The Cow Tree of the Rainforest">
  **Lechoso** (_Brosimum utile_), also known as **Cow Tree** or **Sande**, is
  one of the most remarkable trees of Costa Rica's lowland rainforests. Its name
  comes from the edible white latex ("leche" means milk in Spanish) that
  indigenous peoples have consumed for centuries—a rare example of drinkable
  tree sap.

<AccordionItem title="🔬 Taxonomic Notes">

_Brosimum_ is a Neotropical genus of about 15 species in the mulberry family (Moraceae). The species epithet _utile_ means "useful" in Latin, referring to the tree's many applications.

**Related Species**: The better-known _B. alicastrum_ (Ramón/Ojoche) also occurs in Costa Rica but is more common in dry forests. Both species have edible parts but _B. utile_ is noted for its drinkable latex.

**Latex Chemistry**: The latex contains proteins, sugars, and fats—essentially a complete food—making it one of very few truly edible tree saps in the world.
