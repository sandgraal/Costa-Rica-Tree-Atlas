### Taxonomic Notes

The species was described by the French botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1811. The genus _Simarouba_ contains about 6 species distributed throughout tropical America, all characterized by bitter bark containing quassinoid compounds.

The genus is closely related to _Ailanthus_ (Tree of Heaven) in the same family Simaroubaceae, and shares the characteristic bitter compounds and pinnately compound leaves. _Simarouba glauca_ is the most widespread species in the genus.

### Etymology

- **Simarouba**: From "simaruba," the indigenous Carib name for the tree in the Guianas
- **glauca**: Latin meaning "bluish-gray" or "glaucous," referring to the whitish or grayish undersides of the leaflets

## Physical/Botanical Description

### Tree Form

Comenegro is a medium-sized deciduous to semi-deciduous tree reaching 15-25 meters in height, occasionally taller in optimal conditions. The trunk is straight and cylindrical, typically 30-60 cm in diameter. The crown is broad and spreading, with relatively horizontal branches creating an open, umbrella-like canopy. The tree typically loses its leaves during the dry season, remaining bare for several weeks to months.

### Bark

The bark is the tree's most distinctive feature and a key identifying characteristic. It is remarkably smooth and thin, copper-colored to golden-brown, often with a reddish or orange tinge. The bark peels away in irregular thin patches or papery sheets, revealing lighter-colored, almost golden or yellow inner bark beneath. This creates a beautiful mottled appearance of copper, gold, and cream colors.

The smooth texture and coppery color make Comenegro unmistakable in the forest. When cut or scraped, the bark is intensely bitter due to quassinoid compounds—this bitter taste has been used for centuries to identify the tree and is the basis for its medicinal properties.

### Leaves

  />
  <PropertyCard
    icon="🌿"
    label="Type"
    value="Pinnately compound, 7-15 leaflets"
  />
</PropertiesGrid>

The leaves are pinnately compound (feather-like), 20-40 cm long, with 7-15 leaflets arranged along a central rachis. Individual leaflets are oblong to elliptic, 5-12 cm long and 2-5 cm wide, with entire (smooth) margins and pointed tips. The upper surface is dark green and smooth, while the undersurface is distinctly pale, whitish, or glaucous (bluish-white)—this whitish underside is where the species name "glauca" comes from.

Leaves are clustered near the tips of branches, giving the tree a distinctive appearance. During the dry season, the tree loses all its leaves, remaining bare before producing new foliage at the onset of the rainy season. The fresh young leaves often emerge with a reddish or bronze tinge before turning green.

### Flowers

<PropertiesGrid>
  <PropertyCard
    icon="🌸"
    label="Color"
    value="White to cream, sometimes pink-tinged"

    label="Arrangement"
    value="Terminal panicles (large clusters)"
  />
  <PropertyCard icon="📅" label="Season" value="February-April (dry season)" />
</PropertiesGrid>

The flowers are small, white to cream-colored, sometimes with a pink tinge, appearing in large terminal panicles (branched clusters) 15-30 cm long. Individual flowers are only 5-8 mm in diameter with 5 petals and 10 stamens. Flowers are typically dioecious (male and female flowers on separate trees), though occasionally perfect (bisexual) flowers occur.

Flowering occurs during the late dry season to early rainy season (February-April), often when the tree is leafless or just beginning to produce new leaves. The flower clusters are conspicuous and attract numerous insects for pollination.

### Fruit & Seeds

The fruit is a drupe (stone fruit), ovoid to ellipsoid, approximately 1.5-2 cm long. Immature fruits are green, turning deep purple to nearly black when fully ripe. Each fruit typically contains 1-5 seeds, though often only 1-2 develop fully. The fruits sit in small, cup-like calyces.

The fleshy purple fruits ripen from May through July and are an important food source for birds, which are the primary seed dispersers. Birds swallow the fruits whole and later regurgitate or defecate the seeds, facilitating forest regeneration and colonization of open areas.

Seeds are small, about 1 cm long, flattened, and contain bitter compounds similar to the bark.

### Traditional Medicinal Uses

**Bark Medicine**: The bitter bark of Comenegro has been used in traditional medicine throughout its range for centuries:

- **Dysentery and Diarrhea**: The most famous use; bark extract has been used to treat dysentery (bloody diarrhea) caused by parasites
- **Intestinal Parasites**: Used to expel intestinal worms and other parasites
- **Fever**: Bark tea used as febrifuge (fever reducer)
- **Malaria**: Historically used as antimalarial remedy
- **Digestive Tonic**: Small amounts used as bitter tonic to stimulate digestion

The bark contains quassinoid compounds (particularly glaucarubin and ailanthin) which have demonstrated antiparasitic, antimalarial, and antiamoebic properties in scientific studies. These compounds are intensely bitter—100,000 times more bitter than quinine.

**Historical Significance**: Comenegro bark was exported from the Caribbean to Europe in the 18th-19th centuries as a medicinal drug for treating dysentery and tropical fevers. It was included in European and American pharmacopeias as "Simaruba bark."

**Modern Use**: While largely replaced by modern medications, bark extracts are still used in some traditional medicine practices and have been investigated for potential pharmaceutical applications, including as antimalarial and anticancer compounds.

**Caution**: Medicinal use of bark should only be undertaken with proper knowledge. Excessive doses can cause vomiting and gastrointestinal irritation.

### Timber Uses

**Wood Characteristics**:

- **Texture**: Fine to medium, even texture
- **Grain**: Straight to slightly interlocked
- **Color**: Pale yellow-white to cream
- **Density**: Light and soft (specific gravity 0.35-0.45)
- **Workability**: Excellent—easy to saw, plane, and work
- **Durability**: Low natural durability; not resistant to decay or insects

**Traditional and Commercial Uses**:

- **Matches**: Historically a major use; the light, soft wood is ideal for matchsticks and match boxes
- **Crates and Boxes**: Used for shipping crates, fruit boxes, and light packaging
- **Pulp and Paper**: Suitable for pulp production
- **Plywood**: Used in plywood core stock
- **Carving**: Easy to carve; used for small handicrafts and utility items
- **Fuel**: Used as firewood, though not preferred due to fast growth potential

The wood is too light and soft for construction or furniture, but its ease of working and uniform texture make it valuable for specialized applications. Its pale color is also aesthetically pleasing.

### Agroforestry Applications

Comenegro is increasingly recognized for agroforestry systems:

- **Shade Tree**: Used in coffee and cacao plantations for dappled shade
- **Living Fences**: Can be planted as living fence posts
- **Alley Cropping**: Incorporated into alley cropping systems; leaf litter improves soil
- **Fodder**: Leaves occasionally used as supplementary livestock fodder (though bitter)
- **Soil Improvement**: Deep roots mine nutrients; leaf litter adds organic matter

### Reforestation and Restoration

**Excellent Reforestation Species** because:

1. **Fast Growth**: Grows quickly on degraded lands
2. **Drought Tolerance**: Survives dry season stress that kills other planted trees
3. **Poor Soil Tolerance**: Establishes on marginal, eroded, or rocky soils
4. **Easy Propagation**: Seeds and cuttings both viable
5. **Wildlife Attraction**: Fruits attract seed-dispersing birds that bring in other native species
6. **Nurse Tree**: Creates shade for more demanding species to establish beneath

Used extensively in tropical dry forest restoration projects in Costa Rica and throughout Central America.

### Other Uses

- **Ornamental**: Planted as shade tree for its attractive copper bark and spreading crown
- **Honey Production**: Flowers visited by bees
- **Erosion Control**: Deep roots stabilize slopes

## Cultural & Historical Significance

### Indigenous Knowledge

Indigenous peoples throughout the tree's range recognized the medicinal properties of Comenegro bark. The Mayan name "Pasak" refers to the bitter medicine derived from the bark. Indigenous healers used carefully prepared bark extracts for treating stomach ailments, fevers, and parasitic infections long before European contact.

### Colonial Medicine Trade

During the colonial period (17th-19th centuries), Comenegro bark became an important export commodity from the Caribbean and Central America to Europe. Known as "Simaruba bark" or "Dysentery bark," it was shipped to European ports where it was sold to pharmacies and physicians.

The bark's reputation for treating tropical dysentery made it valuable during a time when tropical diseases were poorly understood and effective treatments rare. It was officially listed in the London Pharmacopoeia (1788) and other European pharmaceutical references.

### Regional Importance

In Costa Rica and Central America:

- **Traditional Medicine**: Still used in rural areas for digestive problems, though less common with access to modern medicine
- **Forest Identity**: The distinctive copper bark makes it a recognizable component of dry forest landscapes
- **Reforestation Symbol**: Now seen as important native species for ecological restoration

### Cultural Names

The name "Comenegro" (literally "eat black") is curious—its exact origin is unclear, but it may refer to the dark purple fruits or possibly the intensely bitter (black) taste of the bark. Other common names like "Bitterwood" and the genus name from indigenous "simaruba" all emphasize the bitter medicinal properties that have defined human relationships with this tree for centuries.

## Conservation Status

<Callout type="success" title="Least Concern">
  Simarouba glauca is assessed as **Least Concern (LC)** by the IUCN. The
  species has a very wide geographic distribution across the tropics and remains
  common in many areas. However, local populations in heavily deforested regions
  have declined.
</Callout>

### Current Status

Globally, the species is not threatened and maintains extensive populations throughout its wide range. In Costa Rica, it remains relatively common in protected dry forests and is not considered at risk nationally.

### Threats

Despite its "Least Concern" status, Comenegro faces localized pressures:

1. **Habitat Loss**: Conversion of dry forests to cattle pasture and agriculture (particularly in Guanacaste) has reduced total habitat
2. **Dry Forest Decline**: Tropical dry forests are one of the most threatened ecosystems in Costa Rica and worldwide; only about 2% of original Costa Rican dry forest remains
3. **Bark Harvesting**: Historical overharvesting for medicinal bark depleted some local populations, though this is now rare
4. **Fire**: Increased fire frequency in degraded dry forests can damage populations

### Protection Measures

Comenegro benefits from conservation efforts:

- Protected in numerous national parks and reserves, particularly dry forest protected areas (Santa Rosa, Palo Verde, Barra Honda)
- Included in dry forest restoration projects throughout Guanacaste and northwest Costa Rica
- Promoted in agroforestry systems as alternative to clear-cutting
- Seeds and germplasm maintained in forestry programs
- Growing recognition of value for climate-adapted reforestation (drought tolerance valuable as climate changes)

### Conservation Outlook

The species' wide distribution, drought tolerance, fast growth, and ease of propagation make it a low conservation concern. Its increasing use in reforestation may actually expand its distribution. The primary conservation concern is maintaining overall dry forest ecosystem integrity rather than the species itself.

## Growing Comenegro

### Propagation

**From Seed**:

Seeds should be collected from ripe fruits (dark purple to black) in May-July. This is the most common propagation method.

- **Collection**: Gather fallen fruits beneath parent trees or collect directly from tree
- **Processing**: Remove fleshy pulp by mashing and washing; seeds are small and flattened
- **Viability**: Seeds remain viable for several months if stored dry and cool; best results with fresh seeds
- **Sowing**: Plant seeds 1-2 cm deep in nursery beds or containers filled with sandy, well-drained mix
- **Germination**: Relatively good germination rates (50-70%); germination begins in 2-4 weeks and continues over 1-3 months
- **Pre-treatment**: Soaking seeds in water for 24 hours before sowing may improve germination

**From Cuttings**:

Comenegro can be propagated from cuttings, though this is less common:

- **Material**: Use semi-hardwood stem cuttings 15-25 cm long, 1-2 cm diameter
- **Preparation**: Remove leaves except for 1-2 at tip; treat cut end with rooting hormone
- **Planting**: Insert cuttings 1/3 to 1/2 their length into rooting medium (sand or sand/peat mix)
- **Care**: Maintain high humidity with misting or plastic cover; provide bright shade
- **Rooting**: Roots develop in 4-8 weeks; success rates variable (30-60%)

**Direct Seeding**:

In reforestation projects, direct seeding (planting seeds directly in field) is sometimes used, though survival rates are lower than transplanting nursery seedlings.

### Nursery Care

**Seedling Management**:

- **Shade**: Provide 50% shade for first 2-3 months, then gradually increase light
- **Watering**: Keep soil moist but not waterlogged; water daily during dry weather
- **Containers**: Use bags or pots at least 15-20 cm deep to accommodate taproot
- **Transplanting**: Seedlings ready to transplant when 30-50 cm tall (4-6 months)
- **Hardening**: Gradually expose to full sun 2-3 weeks before outplanting

### Site Selection

Choose appropriate sites for successful establishment:

- **Climate**: Lowland tropical zones with warm temperatures
- **Elevation**: Sea level to 1000 m; best below 600 m
- **Rainfall**: Areas receiving 1000-2500 mm annual rainfall with defined dry season
- **Soil**: Adapts to almost any well-drained soil, including poor, rocky, or shallow soils
- **Light**: Full sun essential for good growth
- **Exposure**: Tolerates exposed, hot sites once established

Comenegro is excellent for degraded sites, eroded slopes, and marginal agricultural lands unsuitable for many other species.

### Planting

1. **Timing**: Plant at beginning of rainy season (May-June) for best establishment
2. **Site Preparation**: Clear competing vegetation in 1 m radius; no need for soil amendment even on poor sites
3. **Hole**: Dig planting hole larger than container (30 x 30 x 30 cm minimum)
4. **Planting**: Remove container carefully to preserve taproot; plant at same depth as in container
5. **Firming**: Firm soil gently around roots to eliminate air pockets
6. **Watering**: Water thoroughly after planting; create shallow basin around tree to capture rainfall
7. **Mulch**: Apply organic mulch (leaves, grass, wood chips) around base to retain moisture and suppress weeds

### Spacing

- **Timber/pulp production**: 4-5 m spacing (400-625 trees/hectare)—not commonly done due to soft wood
- **Agroforestry/shade**: 8-12 m spacing (70-155 trees/hectare)
- **Mixed reforestation**: 5-10 m spacing with other native species
- **Landscape/ornamental**: 10-15 m from structures and other large trees

### Care Requirements

</PropertiesGrid>

**Watering**:

- **First year**: Water during dry periods (every 1-2 weeks if no rain)
- **Second year**: Minimal supplemental watering needed; only during severe drought
- **Established**: No irrigation needed; tree is extremely drought-tolerant

**Fertilizing**:
Generally not necessary even on poor soils. In very degraded sites, light application of organic compost during first year may boost growth, but tree grows well without amendment.

**Weeding**:
Essential during first 1-2 years. Maintain weed-free circle 1 m radius around young trees. After 2-3 years, tree grows fast enough to shade out most competition.

**Pruning**:
Minimal pruning needed. For timber production, prune lower branches to 2-3 m height as tree grows. Remove any dead or damaged branches. Generally low-maintenance.

**Pest/Disease Management**:
Comenegro is remarkably pest and disease resistant. Few serious problems have been reported. The bitter compounds in the bark and leaves likely deter many herbivores.

### Common Growing Problems

1. **Poor establishment in deep shade**:
   - **Solution**: Comenegro requires full sun; not suitable for understory planting
2. **Slow growth in poorly drained soils**:
   - **Solution**: Improve drainage; plant on slight mound; choose better site
3. **Seedling mortality from drought in first dry season**:
   - **Solution**: Provide supplemental watering during establishment year; mulch heavily
4. **Leaf drop during dry season (normal)**:
   - **Solution**: No action needed; tree will refoliate naturally with rains; this is normal deciduous behavior
5. **Irregular germination**:
   - **Solution**: Plant multiple seeds; extend germination period observation to 3 months

### Growth Expectations

- **Year 1**: 50-100 cm growth; focus on root establishment
- **Years 2-5**: 1-2 m/year growth; rapid vertical growth
- **Years 5-10**: 1-1.5 m/year; crown development begins
- **Years 10-15**: 0.5-1 m/year; tree approaches mature size (8-15 m)
- **Maturity**: 15-25 years to reach full size (15-25 m height)

Growth rates vary significantly with soil, rainfall, and care. Trees in moist, fertile sites grow faster than those on poor, dry sites, but even marginal sites produce reasonable growth.

## Similar Species

Comenegro has distinctive features but can potentially be confused with a few species:

### Simarouba amara (Bitter Ash, Cedro Amargo)

**Key differences**:

- _S. amara_ occurs in wetter rainforests, not dry forests (1500-4000 mm rainfall zones)
- _S. amara_ leaves have more leaflets (10-20 vs. 7-15)
- _S. amara_ has smooth gray bark, not copper-colored
- _S. glauca_ is more drought-tolerant and deciduous
- In Costa Rica, _S. amara_ is found in Caribbean lowland rainforests while _S. glauca_ is more common in seasonal dry forests

Both species have bitter bark used medicinally, but _S. glauca_ (Comenegro) has the distinctive copper/golden bark.

### Bursera simaruba (Indio Desnudo / Gumbo Limbo)

**Similar features**: Both have smooth, peeling bark with copper/reddish tones

**Key differences**:

- _Bursera simaruba_ bark is more red-brown and peels in thin papery sheets (paper-like)
- _B. simaruba_ leaves are compound with fewer, larger leaflets (5-9 leaflets)
- _B. simaruba_ has resinous sap (turpentine odor)
- _Simarouba glauca_ bark is more golden-copper and bark/leaves are bitter (not resinous)
- _B. simaruba_ propagates extremely easily from large cuttings (stakes root)

Both are common dry forest trees, but bark texture and leaf characteristics distinguish them.

### Swietenia macrophylla (Caoba / Mahogany)

**Similar features**: Both have compound leaves and are valued timber trees

**Key differences**:

- _Swietenia_ bark is dark gray-brown and furrowed, not smooth copper
- _Swietenia_ leaves are larger with more leaflets
- _Swietenia_ has large woody capsule fruits (10-15 cm long)
- _Simarouba_ has small purple drupes (1.5-2 cm)
- _Swietenia_ wood is heavy, hard, and very valuable; _Simarouba_ wood is light and soft
- Habitats differ: _Swietenia_ in moist forests; _Simarouba glauca_ in drier forests

### Other Pinnate-Leaved Trees

Several other Costa Rican trees have pinnately compound leaves:

- **_Spondias_ species** (Jobo, Jocote) - Different bark, larger leaflets, different fruits
- **_Cedrela odorata_** (Spanish Cedar) - Aromatic wood (not bitter), different bark
- **_Gliricidia sepium_** (Madero Negro) - Smaller tree, pink flowers, smooth gray bark

**Distinctive Identification Features of _Simarouba glauca_**:

1. Smooth copper-golden bark that peels in patches
2. Intensely bitter taste of bark and leaves (don't taste unknown trees, but historic identification method)
3. Compound leaves with whitish (glaucous) undersides
4. Small dark purple fruits
5. Deciduous habit in dry season
6. Dry forest habitat preference

## Identification Guide

### Field Identification Key

1. **Habitat**: Tropical dry forest or seasonal moist forest (0-1000 m) → consistent with _S. glauca_
2. **Bark**: Smooth, copper-colored, peeling in patches → diagnostic for _S. glauca_
3. **Leaves**: Pinnately compound, 7-15 leaflets, whitish beneath → consistent
4. **Deciduous**: Loses all leaves in dry season → confirms
5. **Fruits** (if present): Small dark purple drupes → confirms _Simarouba_
6. **Bitter taste**: Bark and leaves intensely bitter → diagnostic (though taste-testing should be done with caution and expertise)

### Seasonal Identification

- **November-February** (Dry season): Leafless or losing leaves; distinctive copper bark very visible
- **February-April** (Late dry): Flowering; white flower clusters on bare branches or with new leaves
- **April-May** (Early rainy): Leaf flush; fresh reddish-bronze new leaves
- **May-July** (Rainy season): Fruiting; purple fruits ripen
- **May-November** (Rainy season): Fully leafed; whitish leaf undersides visible

### Bark Identification

The copper-colored, smooth, peeling bark is diagnostic and allows identification year-round, even when tree is leafless. The golden-copper color with mottled patches of cream where bark has peeled is unmistakable once learned.
