## Overview

_Simarouba glauca_, commonly known as Comenegro or Paradise Tree, is a medium to large deciduous tree native to tropical regions from Mexico through Central America to northern South America and the Caribbean. In Costa Rica, it grows primarily in the lowland dry forests of Guanacaste and the Pacific slope, where it is valued for its distinctive copper-colored bark and medicinal properties.

The Comenegro is immediately recognizable by its smooth, copper to golden bark that peels in irregular patches, revealing lighter-colored underbark. This characteristic makes it one of the most visually distinctive trees in Costa Rican dry forests, especially during the dry season when it drops its leaves and the bark stands out dramatically.

The tree has a long history of medicinal use. Its bark, leaves, and seeds contain bitter compounds (quassinoids) that have been used for centuries by indigenous peoples and in colonial medicine to treat digestive disorders, fevers, and parasitic infections. The bitter taste is so characteristic that the tree's bark was once exported to Europe as "Simaruba bark" or "dysentery bark."

Beyond its medicinal value, the Comenegro is increasingly recognized as an important species for reforestation, particularly in degraded dry forest areas. Its exceptional drought tolerance, rapid growth, and ability to thrive in poor soils make it an ideal candidate for ecological restoration and agroforestry systems.

## Cultural & Historical Significance

### Indigenous Knowledge

Indigenous peoples throughout the tree's range recognized the medicinal properties of Comenegro bark. The Mayan name "Pasak" refers to the bitter medicine derived from the bark. Indigenous healers used carefully prepared bark extracts to treat stomach ailments, fevers, and parasitic infections long before European contact.

### Colonial Medicine Trade

During the colonial period (17th-19th centuries), Comenegro bark became an important export commodity from the Caribbean and Central America to Europe. Known as "Simaruba bark" or "dysentery bark," it was shipped to European ports where it was sold to pharmacies and physicians.

The bark's reputation for treating tropical dysentery made it valuable during an era when tropical diseases were poorly understood and effective treatments were rare. It was officially listed in the London Pharmacopoeia (1788) and other European pharmaceutical references.

### Regional Importance

In Costa Rica and Central America:

- **Traditional medicine**: Still used in rural areas for digestive problems, though less common with access to modern medicine
- **Forest identity**: The distinctive copper bark makes it a recognizable component of dry forest landscapes
- **Reforestation symbol**: Now seen as an important native species for ecological restoration

### Cultural Names

The name "Comenegro" (literally "eat black") is curious—its exact origin is unclear but may refer to the dark purple fruits or possibly the intensely bitter (black) taste of the bark. Other common names like "Bitterwood" and the genus name from indigenous "simaruba" all emphasize the bitter medicinal properties that have defined human relationships with this tree for centuries.

## Conservation Status

<Callout type="success" title="Least Concern">
  Simarouba glauca is assessed as **Least Concern (LC)** by the IUCN. The
  species has a very wide geographic distribution across the tropics and remains
  common in many areas. However, local populations in heavily deforested regions
  have declined.
</Callout>

### Current Status

Globally, the species is not threatened and maintains extensive populations throughout its wide range. In Costa Rica, it remains relatively common in protected dry forests and is not considered at risk nationally.

### Threats

Despite its "Least Concern" status, the Comenegro faces localized pressures:

1. **Habitat loss**: Conversion of dry forests to cattle pasture and agriculture (particularly in Guanacaste) has reduced total habitat
2. **Dry forest decline**: Tropical dry forests are one of the most threatened ecosystems in Costa Rica and globally; only about 2% of Costa Rica's original dry forest remains
3. **Bark harvesting**: Historical overexploitation for medicinal bark depleted some local populations, though this is now rare
4. **Fire**: Increased fire frequency in degraded dry forests can damage populations

### Protection Measures

The Comenegro benefits from conservation efforts:

- Protected in numerous national parks and reserves, particularly dry forest protected areas (Santa Rosa, Palo Verde, Barra Honda)
- Included in dry forest restoration projects throughout Guanacaste and northwestern Costa Rica
- Promoted in agroforestry systems as an alternative to clearcutting
- Seeds and germplasm maintained in forestry programs
- Growing recognition of value for climate-adapted reforestation (drought tolerance valuable as climate changes)

### Conservation Outlook

The species' wide distribution, drought tolerance, rapid growth, and ease of propagation make it of low conservation concern. Its increasing use in reforestation may actually expand its distribution. The primary conservation concern is maintaining overall dry forest ecosystem integrity rather than the species itself.

---

## Cultivation

### Propagation

**From Seed**:

Seeds should be collected from ripe fruits (dark purple to black) in May-July. This is the most common propagation method.

- **Collection**: Gather fallen fruits under parent trees or collect directly from tree
- **Processing**: Remove fleshy pulp by mashing and washing; seeds are small and flattened
- **Viability**: Seeds remain viable for several months if stored dry and cool; best results with fresh seeds
- **Sowing**: Plant seeds 1-2 cm deep in nursery beds or containers filled with well-draining sandy mix
- **Germination**: Relatively good germination rates (50-70%); germination begins in 2-4 weeks and continues for 1-3 months
- **Pre-treatment**: Soaking seeds in water for 24 hours before sowing may improve germination

**From Cuttings**:

The Comenegro can be propagated from cuttings, though this is less common:

- **Material**: Use semi-hardwood stem cuttings 15-25 cm long, 1-2 cm diameter
- **Preparation**: Remove leaves except 1-2 at tip; treat cut end with rooting hormone
- **Planting**: Insert cuttings 1/3 to 1/2 their length into rooting medium (sand or sand/peat mix)
- **Care**: Maintain high humidity with misting or plastic cover; provide bright shade
- **Rooting**: Roots develop in 4-8 weeks; success rates variable (30-60%)

**Direct Seeding**:

In reforestation projects, direct seeding (planting seeds directly in the field) is sometimes used, though survival rates are lower than transplanting nursery seedlings.

### Nursery Care

**Seedling Management**:

- **Shade**: Provide 50% shade for first 2-3 months, then gradually increase light
- **Watering**: Keep soil moist but not waterlogged; water daily during dry weather
- **Containers**: Use bags or pots at least 15-20 cm deep to accommodate taproot
- **Transplanting**: Seedlings ready for transplanting when 30-50 cm tall (4-6 months)
- **Hardening**: Gradually expose to full sun 2-3 weeks before planting out

### Site Selection

Choose appropriate sites for successful establishment:

- **Climate**: Tropical lowland zones with warm temperatures
- **Elevation**: Sea level to 1,000 m; best below 600 m
- **Rainfall**: Areas receiving 1,000-2,500 mm annual rainfall with defined dry season
- **Soil**: Adapts to almost any well-drained soil, including poor, rocky, or shallow soils
- **Light**: Full sun essential for good growth
- **Exposure**: Tolerates exposed, hot sites once established

The Comenegro is excellent for degraded sites, eroded slopes, and marginal agricultural lands unsuitable for many other species.

### Planting

1. **Timing**: Plant at the start of rainy season (May-June) for best establishment
2. **Site preparation**: Clear competing vegetation in 1 m radius; no soil amendment needed even on poor sites
3. **Hole**: Dig planting hole larger than container (30 x 30 x 30 cm minimum)
4. **Planting**: Remove container carefully to preserve taproot; plant at same depth as in nursery container
5. **Firming**: Gently firm soil around roots to eliminate air pockets
6. **Watering**: Water thoroughly after planting; create shallow basin around tree to capture rain
7. **Mulch**: Apply organic mulch (leaves, grass, wood chips) around base to retain moisture and suppress weeds

### Spacing

- **Timber/pulp production**: 4-5 m spacing (400-625 trees/hectare)—not commonly done due to soft wood
- **Agroforestry/shade**: 8-12 m spacing (70-155 trees/hectare)
- **Mixed reforestation**: 5-10 m spacing with other native species
- **Landscaping/ornamental**: 10-15 m from structures and other large trees

### Care Requirements

  items={[
    { label: "Light", value: "Full sun required" },
    { label: "Water", value: "Moderate when young, low once established" },
    { label: "Temperature", value: "Warm tropical (24-30°C)" },
    { label: "Soil", value: "Highly adaptable, well-drained" },
  ]}
/>

**Watering**:

- **First year**: Water during dry periods (every 1-2 weeks if no rain)
- **Second year**: Minimal supplemental watering needed; only during severe drought
- **Established**: No watering needed; tree is extremely drought tolerant

**Fertilization**:
Generally not necessary even on poor soils. On highly degraded sites, light application of organic compost during first year may boost growth, but tree grows well without amendment.

**Weed Control**:
Essential during first 1-2 years. Maintain weed-free circle of 1 m radius around young trees. After 2-3 years, tree grows fast enough to shade out most competition.

**Pruning**:
Minimal pruning needed. For timber production, prune lower branches to 2-3 m height as tree grows. Remove dead or damaged branches. Generally low maintenance.

**Pest/Disease Management**:
The Comenegro is notably resistant to pests and diseases. Few serious problems have been reported. The bitter compounds in bark and leaves likely deter many herbivores.

### Common Cultivation Problems

1. **Poor establishment in deep shade**:
   - **Solution**: Comenegro requires full sun; not suitable for understory planting
2. **Slow growth in poorly drained soils**:
   - **Solution**: Improve drainage; plant on slight mound; choose better site
3. **Seedling mortality from drought in first dry season**:
   - **Solution**: Provide supplemental water during establishment year; apply heavy mulch
4. **Leaf drop during dry season (normal)**:
   - **Solution**: No action required; tree will releaf naturally with rains; this is normal deciduous behavior
5. **Irregular germination**:
   - **Solution**: Plant multiple seeds; extend germination observation period to 3 months

### Growth Expectations

- **Year 1**: 50-100 cm growth; focus on root establishment
- **Years 2-5**: 1-2 m/year growth; rapid vertical growth
- **Years 5-10**: 1-1.5 m/year; crown development begins
- **Years 10-15**: 0.5-1 m/year; tree approaches mature size (8-15 m)
- **Maturity**: 15-25 years to reach full size (15-25 m height)

Growth rates vary significantly with soil, rainfall, and care. Trees on moist, fertile sites grow faster than those on poor, dry sites, but even marginal sites produce reasonable growth.

## Similar Species

The Comenegro has distinctive characteristics but can potentially be confused with some species:

### Simarouba amara (Bitter Cedar)

**Key differences**:

- _S. amara_ occurs in wetter rainforests, not dry forests (rainfall zones 1,500-4,000 mm)
- _S. amara_ has more leaflets (10-20 vs. 7-15)
- _S. amara_ has smooth gray bark, not copper-colored
- _S. glauca_ is more drought-tolerant and deciduous
- In Costa Rica, _S. amara_ is found in Caribbean lowland rainforests while _S. glauca_ is most common in seasonally dry forests

Both species have bitter bark used medicinally, but _S. glauca_ (Comenegro) has the distinctive copper/golden bark.

### Bursera simaruba (Gumbo Limbo / Indio Desnudo)

1. Smooth copper-golden bark that peels in patches
2. Intensely bitter taste of bark and leaves (do not taste unknown trees, but historical identification method)
3. Compound leaves with whitish (glaucous) undersides
4. Small dark purple fruits
5. Deciduous habit in dry season
6. Dry forest habitat preference

## Identification Guide

### Field Identification Key

1. **Habitat**: Tropical dry forest or seasonal moist forest (0-1,000 m) → consistent with _S. glauca_
2. **Bark**: Smooth, copper-colored, peeling in patches → diagnostic for _S. glauca_
3. **Leaves**: Pinnately compound, 7-15 leaflets, whitish beneath → consistent
4. **Deciduous**: Drops all leaves in dry season → confirms
5. **Fruits** (if present): Small dark purple drupes → confirms _Simarouba_
6. **Bitter taste**: Bark and leaves intensely bitter → diagnostic (though taste test should be done with caution and experience)

### Seasonal Identification

- **November-February** (Dry season): Leafless or losing leaves; distinctive copper bark very visible
- **February-April** (Late dry): Flowering; white flower clusters on bare or newly leafing branches
- **April-May** (Early wet): Leaf flush; fresh new leaves bronze-reddish
- **May-July** (Wet season): Fruiting; purple fruits ripen
- **May-November** (Wet season): Fully leafed; whitish leaf undersides visible

### Bark Identification

The smooth copper-colored bark that peels is diagnostic and allows year-round identification, even when tree is leafless. The copper-golden color with mottled cream patches where bark has peeled is unmistakable once learned.
