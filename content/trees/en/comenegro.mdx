# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "low"
toxicParts: ["bark"]
skinContactRisk: "low"
allergenRisk: "low"
structuralRisks: []
childSafe: true
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "The bark of Simarouba glauca contains bitter compounds (quassinoids) used medicinally. The bark is very bitter but not dangerously toxic when used appropriately. Excessive consumption could cause digestive upset. The tree itself is not toxic to touch or be near."
skinContactDetails: "Minimal risk from skin contact. The bark contains bitter compounds but is not caustic or irritating to the skin. Some individuals may experience mild sensitivity. Generally safe to handle."
allergenDetails: "Low allergen risk. Pollen may cause mild reactions in sensitive individuals during flowering season, but significant allergies are uncommon."
structuralRiskDetails: "No significant structural risks. Medium-sized tree with relatively soft wood. Not prone to dangerous branch drop under normal conditions."
safetyNotes: "Comenegro is a safe tree for landscapes and natural areas. Medicinal bark should only be used under appropriate guidance. The tree is beneficial to wildlife and presents minimal risk to people or pets."
wildlifeRisks: "Safe for wildlife. Fruits are consumed by birds. Non-toxic to domestic animals. Bitter bark is generally avoided by livestock."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "moderate-to-fast"
growthRateDetails: "Moderate to fast growth under suitable conditions; can reach 8-15 meters in 10-15 years"
matureSize: "15-25 m tall (50-82 feet) with trunk diameter 30-60 cm; develops broad, spreading crown"
hardiness: "Tropical lowlands and dry forests 0-1000m; extremely drought tolerant once established; not frost tolerant"
soilRequirements: "Adapts to various well-drained soils including poor and rocky soils; pH 6.0-8.0; thrives in both fertile and marginal soils"
waterNeeds: "low-to-moderate"
waterDetails: "Requires regular moisture when young. Once established, highly drought tolerant and can survive extended dry seasons. Prefers areas with 1000-2500 mm annual rainfall but adapts to drier conditions."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plant 8-12 m (26-40 feet) apart for mixed planting; wider for landscape use"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
  - "cuttings"
propagationDifficulty: "easy"
plantingSeason: "Plant at the start of rainy season (May-June) for best establishment"
maintenanceNeeds: "Very low maintenance once established. Drought tolerant and pest resistant. Young trees benefit from weed control and watering during first dry season. Minimal pruning needed. Excellent for low-maintenance landscapes and reforestation projects."
commonProblems:
  - "Slow establishment in first year - provide water during dry periods"
  - "May lose leaves in severe drought - normal, will refoliate with rains"
  - "Not suitable for cold areas - requires tropical conditions"
  - "Seeds germinate irregularly - plant multiple seeds"

## Overview

Comenegro is a remarkable tropical tree that stands out in Central American forests for its beautiful peeling bark and significant ethnobotanical history. The tree's common name "Comenegro" means "eat black" in Spanish, possibly referring to the dark outer bark, though the inner bark reveals stunning golden colors. Native peoples and later settlers discovered the bark's powerful medicinal properties - so bitter that even tiny amounts can be tasted.
