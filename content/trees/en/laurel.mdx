# Laurel (Spanish Elm)

<Callout type="success" title="The Perfect Timber-Shade Tree">
  **Laurel** (_Cordia alliodora_), also known as **Spanish Elm** or **Ecuador
  Laurel**, represents the ideal convergence of timber value and agroforestry
  utility. This fast-growing native produces **beautiful, durable wood** prized
  for furniture and construction, while its slender crown provides **perfect
  filtered shade** for coffee and cacao. Throughout Costa Rica, Laurel stands
  tall in coffee plantations, its presence representing decades of farmer
  wisdom—a tree that pays its way while improving the farm.

## Physical Description

### General Form

Laurel is a medium to tall deciduous or semi-deciduous tree with a remarkably straight trunk—one of the straightest-growing native species. The crown is typically narrow and elongated when grown in forest or plantation conditions, broader when open-grown. Distinctive swollen nodes on branches house symbiotic ants.

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

<Callout type="tip" title="The Ant Partnership">
  Laurel has one of the most interesting mutualisms in tropical trees. Swollen
  chambers (domatia) at branch nodes house colonies of _Azteca_ ants. In return
  for shelter, the ants aggressively defend the tree against leaf-eating insects
  and browsing animals. Tap a Laurel branch and watch the ants swarm out!

## Agroforestry Systems

### Coffee Shade

<Callout type="success" title="The Coffee Farmer's Tree">
  Laurel is perhaps the most important shade tree in Central American coffee: -
  **Shade Quality**: Light, filtered—perfect for coffee - **Crown Form**:
  Narrow, allows light penetration - **Root Competition**: Deep roots, minimal
  competition - **Nitrogen**: Not N-fixing but decomposes well - **Timber
  Income**: Trees harvested after 20-30 years - **Tradition**: Used for
  generations throughout region A coffee farm with mature Laurels represents
  both agricultural and timber wealth.

## Cultivation and Management

### Growing Laurel

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Propagation

**Seeds (Primary Method)**

1. Collect mature seeds when calyx turns brown
2. Seeds viable for several months if stored dry
3. Direct sow or nursery production
4. Germination in 2-3 weeks
5. Transplant at 30-50 cm height

**Cuttings (Limited)**

- Possible but less common than seed
- Stakes may establish for living fence

</Column>
<Column>

#### Site Requirements

<SimpleList
  items={[
    "Sun: Full sun essential for good form",
    "Soil: Well-drained; tolerates variety",
    "Spacing: 3x3 m (plantations) to 10x10 m (agroforestry)",
    "Rainfall: 1,500+ mm or irrigation",
    "Elevation: Below 1,500 m",
  ]}
/>

#### Management

- Thin plantations for saw timber quality
- Prune only if necessary (natural self-pruning)
- Protect from fire when young
- Monitor for stem borers

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

### Plantation Forestry

<Callout type="info" title="Reforestation Workhorse">
  Laurel is a top choice for reforestation in Central America: - **Fast
  Establishment**: Good survival, rapid growth - **Low Maintenance**:
  Self-pruning, good form - **Financial Return**: Valuable timber in 15-25 years
  - **Environmental Services**: Carbon, biodiversity, watershed - **Mixed
  Systems**: Combines with coffee, cacao for income It's a key species in Costa
  Rica's Payment for Environmental Services (PES) program.

    The straight trunk + whorled branching + swollen ant nodes are distinctive.

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Field Tests">
    **Quick Identification:**

    - **Crush a leaf:** Mild garlic odor
    - **Tap a branch:** Ants may emerge from swollen nodes
    - **Feel leaf surface:** Rough, sandpaper-like above
    - **Check trunk:** Exceptionally straight

<Callout type="success" title="A Tree for the Future">
  Laurel represents sustainable forestry at its finest—a native species that
  grows fast, produces valuable wood, integrates into farming systems, and
  regenerates naturally. In a world seeking alternatives to deforestation and
  plantation monocultures, Laurel offers a path forward: trees that benefit
  farmers, wildlife, and the climate simultaneously. When you sip Costa Rican
  coffee, you're likely drinking coffee grown in the shade of Laurel trees that
  will one day become someone's beautiful furniture.
