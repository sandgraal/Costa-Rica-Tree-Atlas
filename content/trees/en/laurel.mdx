# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "none"
toxicParts: []
skinContactRisk: "none"
allergenRisk: "low"
structuralRisks:
  - "falling-branches"
childSafe: true
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "Laurel (Cordia alliodora) is non-toxic and safe around people and animals. No parts of this tree are known to be poisonous. It has been used safely in agroforestry systems, coffee plantations, and home landscapes for generations. The wood, bark, leaves, and flowers pose no ingestion hazards. This is one of the safest native trees for family properties."
skinContactDetails: "No known skin contact risks. The tree does not produce irritating sap, latex, or resins. Wood dust from sawing (as with any wood) may cause mild irritation in sensitive individuals, but this is mechanical rather than chemical. Safe to handle and touch."
allergenDetails: "Pollen may cause minor seasonal allergies in some sensitive individuals, as with many flowering trees. Wood dust exposure during milling may cause respiratory irritation in workers (use dust masks when sawing). Overall allergen risk is low."
structuralRiskDetails: "Large tree reaching 30-45 meters with spreading crown. Falling branches possible during storms, especially as trees age. Consider appropriate spacing from structures and high-traffic areas. The wood is strong and relatively wind-resistant. Regular maintenance recommended for landscape trees."
safetyNotes: "Laurel is an excellent choice for family properties, schools, and public spaces. It has no toxicity concerns, making it safe around children and pets. The tree is valued in agroforestry precisely because it doesn't harm crops or animals. Traditional use in coffee and cacao systems demonstrates its safety. The main consideration is its large size—plant with adequate space for mature dimensions."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "fast"
growthRateDetails: "4-6 ft/year in optimal conditions; reaches 15-20m in 10-15 years"
matureSize: "30-45 m tall (can be pruned/topped for agroforestry at 15-25 m), crown spread 15-25 m"
hardiness: "Tropical lowlands to mid-elevation; optimal 0-1500m; thrives in humid and sub-humid zones"
soilRequirements: "Adaptable pioneer species; grows in poor to rich soils; pH 5-7; prefers well-drained but tolerates seasonally wet; thrives on volcanic and alluvial soils"
waterNeeds: "moderate"
waterDetails: "Moderate water needs. Young trees establish best with regular watering first year. Once established, tolerates dry season well but grows faster with consistent moisture. Ideal for areas with 1500-3500mm annual rainfall. Commonly used in wetter coffee zones. Not for extreme drought areas."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "For timber: 10-15 m spacing; for agroforestry shade: 12-20 m spacing; avoid planting close to buildings due to large mature size"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
  - "seedlings"
propagationDifficulty: "easy"
plantingSeason: "Plant seedlings at start of rainy season (May-June) for best establishment"
maintenanceNeeds: "LOW maintenance pioneer species. Year 1-2: Water weekly during dry periods, weed circle around base, protect from livestock. No fertilizer needed (pioneer adapted to poor soil). Years 3-5: Minimal care. Optional formative pruning to develop straight trunk for timber. Years 5+: Zero maintenance for timber production. For agroforestry shade: Prune/pollard every 2-4 years to maintain 15-20m height, providing mulch/firewood. Tree naturally sheds branches, providing organic matter. IDEAL for low-input systems. Common in 'timber + coffee' polyculture: provides premium wood harvest in 20-30 years while shading coffee during growth. Self-seeds readily in gaps (pioneer species trait) - seedlings can be transplanted or removed."
commonProblems:
  - "Borers in stressed trees - keep tree healthy, remove severely damaged trees"
  - "Branch shedding in mature trees - natural self-pruning, clear fallen branches"
  - "Volunteer seedlings from bird-dispersed seeds - easy to remove or transplant, useful for reforestation"
  - "Wind damage in exposed sites - plant in sheltered locations or mixed stands"
  - "Slow growth in very poor soils - benefits from mulching but not essential"
  - "Competition with crops if planted too close - maintain appropriate spacing in agroforestry"

## Physical Description

### General Form

Laurel is a medium to tall deciduous or semi-deciduous tree with a remarkably straight trunk—one of the straightest-growing native species. The crown is typically narrow and elongated when grown in forest or plantation conditions, broader when open-grown. Distinctive swollen nodes on branches house symbiotic ants.

<Callout type="tip" title="The Ant Partnership">
  Laurel has one of the most interesting mutualisms in tropical trees. Swollen
  chambers (domatia) at branch nodes house colonies of _Azteca_ ants. In return
  for shelter, the ants aggressively defend the tree against leaf-eating insects
  and browsing animals. Tap a Laurel branch and watch the ants swarm out!

<Callout type="success" title="A Tree for the Future">
  Laurel represents sustainable forestry at its finest—a native species that
  grows fast, produces valuable wood, integrates into farming systems, and
  regenerates naturally. In a world seeking alternatives to deforestation and
  plantation monocultures, Laurel offers a path forward: trees that benefit
  farmers, wildlife, and the climate simultaneously. When you sip Costa Rican
  coffee, you're likely drinking coffee grown in the shade of Laurel trees that
  will one day become someone's beautiful furniture.
