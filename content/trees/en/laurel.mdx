# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "none"
toxicParts: []
skinContactRisk: "none"
allergenRisk: "low"
structuralRisks:
  - "falling-branches"
childSafe: true
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "Laurel (Cordia alliodora) is non-toxic and safe around people and animals. No parts of this tree are known to be poisonous. It has been used safely in agroforestry systems, coffee plantations, and home landscapes for generations. The wood, bark, leaves, and flowers pose no ingestion hazards. This is one of the safest native trees for family properties."
skinContactDetails: "No known skin contact risks. The tree does not produce irritating sap, latex, or resins. Wood dust from sawing (as with any wood) may cause mild irritation in sensitive individuals, but this is mechanical rather than chemical. Safe to handle and touch."
allergenDetails: "Pollen may cause minor seasonal allergies in some sensitive individuals, as with many flowering trees. Wood dust exposure during milling may cause respiratory irritation in workers (use dust masks when sawing). Overall allergen risk is low."
structuralRiskDetails: "Large tree reaching 30-45 meters with spreading crown. Falling branches possible during storms, especially as trees age. Consider appropriate spacing from structures and high-traffic areas. The wood is strong and relatively wind-resistant. Regular maintenance recommended for landscape trees."
safetyNotes: "Laurel is an excellent choice for family properties, schools, and public spaces. It has no toxicity concerns, making it safe around children and pets. The tree is valued in agroforestry precisely because it doesn't harm crops or animals. Traditional use in coffee and cacao systems demonstrates its safety. The main consideration is its large size—plant with adequate space for mature dimensions."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "fast"
growthRateDetails: "4-6 ft/year in optimal conditions; reaches 15-20m in 10-15 years"
matureSize: "30-45 m tall (can be pruned/topped for agroforestry at 15-25 m), crown spread 15-25 m"
hardiness: "Tropical lowlands to mid-elevation; optimal 0-1500m; thrives in humid and sub-humid zones"
soilRequirements: "Adaptable pioneer species; grows in poor to rich soils; pH 5-7; prefers well-drained but tolerates seasonally wet; thrives on volcanic and alluvial soils"
waterNeeds: "moderate"
waterDetails: "Moderate water needs. Young trees establish best with regular watering first year. Once established, tolerates dry season well but grows faster with consistent moisture. Ideal for areas with 1500-3500mm annual rainfall. Commonly used in wetter coffee zones. Not for extreme drought areas."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "For timber: 10-15 m spacing; for agroforestry shade: 12-20 m spacing; avoid planting close to buildings due to large mature size"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
  - "seedlings"
propagationDifficulty: "easy"
plantingSeason: "Plant seedlings at start of rainy season (May-June) for best establishment"
maintenanceNeeds: "LOW maintenance pioneer species. Year 1-2: Water weekly during dry periods, weed circle around base, protect from livestock. No fertilizer needed (pioneer adapted to poor soil). Years 3-5: Minimal care. Optional formative pruning to develop straight trunk for timber. Years 5+: Zero maintenance for timber production. For agroforestry shade: Prune/pollard every 2-4 years to maintain 15-20m height, providing mulch/firewood. Tree naturally sheds branches, providing organic matter. IDEAL for low-input systems. Common in 'timber + coffee' polyculture: provides premium wood harvest in 20-30 years while shading coffee during growth. Self-seeds readily in gaps (pioneer species trait) - seedlings can be transplanted or removed."
commonProblems:
  - "Borers in stressed trees - keep tree healthy, remove severely damaged trees"
  - "Branch shedding in mature trees - natural self-pruning, clear fallen branches"
  - "Volunteer seedlings from bird-dispersed seeds - easy to remove or transplant, useful for reforestation"
  - "Wind damage in exposed sites - plant in sheltered locations or mixed stands"
  - "Slow growth in very poor soils - benefits from mulching but not essential"
  - "Competition with crops if planted too close - maintain appropriate spacing in agroforestry"

### Advanced Care Guidance

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Companion Planting & Agroforestry">
    **Beneficial Companions**:
    - **Coffee (_Coffea arabica_)**: Classic shade system; Laurel provides filtered light, nitrogen-rich litter
    - **Cacao (_Theobroma cacao_)**: Compatible in multi-strata agroforestry systems
    - **Banana/Plantain**: Fast-growing nurse crops that provide early income while Laurel matures
    - **Leguminous cover crops (Mucuna, Canavalia)**: Fix nitrogen, suppress weeds, improve soil
    - **Erythrina species**: Nitrogen-fixing nurse trees for initial establishment
    - **Citrus (young plantations)**: Interplanting possible in first 5-7 years before canopy closes

    **Compatible Timber Trees**:
    - Pochote (_Pachira quinata_): Similar growth rate, good mixture
    - Cedro Amargo (_Cedrela odorata_): Classic mixed plantation partner
    - Melina (_Gmelina arborea_): Fast rotation compatible in zoned systems
    - Native hardwoods (Cenízaro, Guanacaste): For biodiverse timber plantations

    **Plants to Avoid**:
    - Shallow-rooted crops in mature plantations (roots compete)
    - Aggressive climbing vines that can damage young stems and canopy
    - Forest floor crops requiring frequent disturbance (incompatible with natural litter layer)

    **Agroforestry Integration**:
    - **Coffee-Laurel Systems**: 3x3m or 4x4m coffee, Laurel at 10x10m overstory (100 trees/ha)
    - **Timber Plantations with Crops**: Interplant subsistence crops (beans, corn, cassava (yuca)) years 1-3
    - **Living Fences**: Plant along property lines at 3-5m spacing for boundary demarcation and timber
    - **Silvopastoral Systems**: Compatible with managed grazing once trunk diameter >20cm and protected
    - **Watershed Protection**: Plant in riparian buffers at 2-3m spacing for erosion control
    - **PES Programs**: Eligible for Costa Rica's Payment for Environmental Services for reforestation/conservation

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Seasonal Care Calendar">
    **December-February (Dry Season)**:
    - Monitor young plantations for water stress
    - Apply irrigation if available (critical for year 1-2 trees)
    - Plan thinning operations (easier access in dry season)
    - Inspect for fire risk and create firebreaks if needed
    - Fertilize established trees (February) if growth is slow

    **March-April (Transition Period)**:
    - Optimal planting time as rains begin (April)
    - Prepare planting sites: clear weeds, dig holes
    - Apply pre-planting fertilizer (rock phosphate or compost)
    - Have seedlings ready (30-50cm tall in bags)
    - Early season flowering begins (mature trees)

    **May-August (Rainy Season - Peak Growth)**:
    - Main planting season (May-June best)
    - Vigorous growth period for all ages
    - Weed control critical for young plantations (monthly weeding years 1-2)
    - Monitor for stem borers and leaf-cutting ants
    - Apply second fertilization if needed (July, young trees only)
    - Flowering continues (mature trees 10+ years)

    **September-November (Late Rainy Season)**:
    - Final planting window (September) if needed
    - Fruit maturation period (mature trees)
    - Collect seeds for next season (October-November)
    - Assess plantation health before dry season
    - Plan thinning and pruning operations for dry season
    - Reduce weeding frequency as growth slows

    **Year-Round Maintenance by Tree Age**:
    - **Years 1-3**: Intensive weed control, protect from fire and livestock, monitor health
    - **Years 4-7**: Reduced maintenance, selective pruning of competing stems (let dominant leader develop)
    - **Years 8-15**: First thinning in plantations (remove 30-40% of trees), monitor for borers
    - **Years 15-25**: Final thinning, select final crop trees, prepare for harvest
    - **Years 25+**: Harvest rotation for timber, or maintain for environmental services

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Pest & Disease Management">
    **Common Pests**:
    - **Stem Borers (Cerambycidae beetles)**: Main threat; larvae bore into trunks causing structural damage
      - **Prevention**: Maintain tree vigor with proper spacing and nutrition
      - **Control**: Remove and burn infested trees promptly; biological control with parasitoid wasps
    - **Leaf-cutting Ants (_Atta_ and _Acromyrmex_ spp.)**: Can defoliate young trees
      - **Control**: Locate and treat nests; physical barriers around young stems; biological baits
    - **Scale Insects**: Occasional on stressed trees
      - **Control**: Horticultural oil sprays; encourage natural predators (ladybugs, lacewings)

    **Diseases**:
    - **Root Rot (_Phytophthora_ spp.)**: In poorly drained soils
      - **Prevention**: Avoid planting in waterlogged areas; improve drainage
      - **Management**: No chemical cure; remove affected trees to prevent spread
    - **Leaf Spots (Various fungi)**: Cosmetic, rarely serious
      - **Management**: Usually no intervention needed; good air circulation helps
    - **Rust Fungi**: Occasional on leaves in humid conditions
      - **Management**: Remove heavily infected leaves; copper fungicides if severe

    **Integrated Pest Management**:
    - Regular monitoring walks through plantations
    - Maintain genetic diversity (multiple seed sources)
    - Avoid monocultures; mix with other species when possible
    - Encourage beneficial insects and birds
    - Promptly remove severely diseased or infested trees
    - Maintain tree vigor through proper nutrition and spacing

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Fertilization & Soil Management">
    **Initial Establishment (Years 1-3)**:
    - **At Planting**: Mix 100-200g rock phosphate or 2-3 kg compost into planting hole
    - **Month 3**: Apply 50g NPK (10-30-10 or similar) per tree around base (rainy season)
    - **Month 12**: Apply 100g NPK (15-15-15) or organic equivalent per tree
    - **Year 2**: Apply 150g NPK (18-5-15-6-2 with micronutrients) per tree
    - **Year 3**: Apply 200g NPK (20-5-15) per tree, or compost (5kg) annually

    **Mature Trees (Years 4+)**:
    - Generally do not require fertilization if soil is reasonable
    - Nitrogen-rich leaf litter self-fertilizes over time
    - In degraded soils: Apply compost or organic matter every 2-3 years
    - Foliar analysis if growth is poor (may indicate micronutrient deficiency)

    **Soil Management Practices**:
    - **Mulching**: Apply organic mulch (10-15cm) around young trees to retain moisture and suppress weeds
    - **Cover Crops**: Plant leguminous cover crops between rows (Mucuna, Canavalia, Desmodium)
    - **Leaf Litter**: Allow natural leaf litter to accumulate (nutrient cycling, moisture retention)
    - **Minimal Soil Disturbance**: Avoid tilling under trees; hand-weed or mulch instead
    - **pH Management**: Laurel tolerates pH 5.5-7.0; lime only if pH < 5.0

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Pruning & Training">
    **Formative Pruning (Years 1-5)**:
    - **Goal**: Establish single straight trunk with minimal branching in lower 2-3 meters
    - **Method**: 
      - Remove competing leaders (keep strongest central stem)
      - Prune low branches gradually (don't remove >1/3 of crown at once)
      - Remove branches at proper angle (flush with trunk, no stubs)
    - **Timing**: Dry season preferred to minimize disease entry
    - **Frequency**: Annual pruning in years 2-5

    **Self-Pruning**:
    - Laurel naturally sheds lower branches as canopy closes
    - In dense plantations (3x3m), lower branches die back naturally
    - Minimal intervention needed in well-spaced, vigorous trees

    **Maintenance Pruning (Years 5+)**:
    - Remove dead or diseased branches promptly
    - Prune damaged branches after storms
    - Generally avoid pruning mature trees unless necessary
    - Heavy pruning can reduce timber quality

    **Thinning Operations (Plantations)**:
    - **Year 8-10 (First Thinning)**: Remove 30-40% of trees
      - Select: Poorest form, slowest growth, diseased trees
      - Leave: Best 60-70% with straight trunks and good health
      - Spacing after thinning: ~5x5m equivalent
    - **Year 15-18 (Second Thinning)**: Remove another 30%
      - Leave final 40-50 trees per hectare (if initial 400/ha)
      - Spacing: 10x10m or equivalent
    - **Thinning Products**: Poles, stakes, fuelwood (income)

<Callout type="success" title="A Tree for the Future">
  Laurel represents sustainable forestry at its finest—a native species that
  grows fast, produces valuable wood, integrates into farming systems, and
  regenerates naturally. In a world seeking alternatives to deforestation and
  plantation monocultures, Laurel offers a path forward: trees that benefit
  farmers, wildlife, and the climate simultaneously. When you sip Costa Rican
  coffee, you're likely drinking coffee grown in the shade of Laurel trees that
  will one day become someone's beautiful furniture.
