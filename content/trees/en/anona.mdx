# Anona (Custard Apple)

<Callout type="success" title="The Underappreciated Custard Apple">
  The **Anona** (_Annona reticulata_), commonly called Custard Apple or
  Bullock's Heart, is the lesser-known sibling in the famous Annona family that
  includes guanábana and chirimoya. Native to the Caribbean and Central America,
  this small tree produces distinctive heart-shaped fruits with a netted pattern
  on the skin. The creamy, custard-like flesh is sweet with hints of vanilla and
  caramel—smoother than guanábana but less famous internationally. In Costa
  Rica, the anona grows well in lowland areas and is appreciated by those who
  seek it out in local markets during its season.

## Physical Description

### General Form

The Anona is a small to medium deciduous or semi-deciduous tree with an open, spreading canopy. It loses its leaves briefly during the dry season, with new growth and flowers emerging as the wet season approaches.

  2. Cut in half or quarters
  3. Scoop out flesh with a spoon
  4. Remove and discard black seeds as you eat
  5. Enjoy the custard-like texture!

## Cultivation

### Growing Anona

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Site Requirements">
    **Ideal Conditions**:
    - Full sun to light shade
    - Well-drained soil essential
    - Protection from strong winds
    - Space 5-6 meters apart
    - Lowland locations preferred

    **Considerations**:
    - Tolerates heat well
    - Semi-deciduous appearance
    - Needs dry period to fruit well
    - Cross-pollination improves yields

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Propagation">
    **From Seed**:
    - Fresh seeds germinate best
    - Scarify or soak seeds 24-48 hours
    - Plant 2-3 cm deep
    - Germination in 2-4 weeks
    - Fruit in 3-5 years

    **Grafting**:
    - For superior varieties
    - Maintains fruit quality
    - Earlier fruiting
    - Use seedling rootstock

    **Air Layering**:
    - Possible but less common
    - Maintains parent characteristics

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Care">
    **Watering**: Regular when young, reduce when established

    **Fertilization**: Balanced NPK 2-3 times yearly

    **Pruning**: Shape when young, remove dead wood

    **Pollination**: Hand pollination recommended for better yields

    **Harvest**: When fruit gives to gentle pressure and color changes
