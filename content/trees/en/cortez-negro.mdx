## Interesting Facts

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="🌸 Synchronized Spectacular">

Cortez Negro trees in an area often bloom simultaneously, creating breathtaking
landscape effects. This synchronization maximizes cross-pollination success and
creates memorable visual displays that attract both pollinators and tourists.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🪵 Harder Than Nails">

Ipê wood is so dense and hard that it's difficult to nail—pre-drilling is
required for any fasteners. The wood's natural oils make it virtually
impervious to rot, insects, and even fire, explaining its premium price in the
international timber market.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🇧🇷 National Treasure">

The Pink Ipê is the national flower of Brazil, where spectacular avenues lined
with these trees create famous "pink tunnels" during flowering season. The
yellow-flowered relative is the national tree of Brazil.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🦠 Lapachol Research">

Scientists have isolated over 20 different compounds from Cortez Negro bark,
including lapachol, which has been studied for potential antimicrobial and
anticancer properties. While promising, more research is needed to validate
traditional medicinal claims.
