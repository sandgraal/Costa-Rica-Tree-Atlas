toxicityDetails: "Non-toxic. All parts of the tree are safe. Tabebuia species (now Handroanthus) are generally non-toxic. Flowers, leaves, and bark do not contain dangerous compounds. Bark has been used medicinally (lapachol compound has antimicrobial properties). Safe tree overall."
skinContactDetails: "No skin irritation from any part of the tree. Safe to handle flowers, leaves, and bark."

## Interesting Facts

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="🌸 Synchronized Spectacular">

Cortez Negro trees in an area often bloom simultaneously, creating breathtaking
landscape effects. This synchronization maximizes cross-pollination success and
creates memorable visual displays that attract both pollinators and tourists.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🪵 Harder Than Nails">

Ipê wood is so dense and hard that it's difficult to nail—pre-drilling is
required for any fasteners. The wood's natural oils make it virtually
impervious to rot, insects, and even fire, explaining its premium price in the
international timber market.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🇧🇷 National Treasure">

The Pink Ipê is the national flower of Brazil, where spectacular avenues lined
with these trees create famous "pink tunnels" during flowering season. The
yellow-flowered relative is the national tree of Brazil.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🦠 Lapachol Research">

Scientists have isolated over 20 different compounds from Cortez Negro bark,
including lapachol, which has been studied for potential antimicrobial and
anticancer properties. While promising, more research is needed to validate
traditional medicinal claims.

## Cultural Significance

<Callout type="leaf" title="A Symbol of Beauty">
  In Costa Rica, the flowering of the Cortez Negro marks the height of the dry
  season and has become associated with the approach of Semana Santa (Holy
  Week). The spectacular pink blooms against a backdrop of brown, dormant
  vegetation create some of the most photographed natural scenes in the country.
  The tree has been increasingly planted in parks and along avenues,
  transforming urban areas into temporary pink wonderlands each February and
  March.
</Callout>

<FeatureBox icon="🇧🇷" title="Brazil's National Flower" variant="highlight">

The Pink Ipê (_Handroanthus impetiginosus_, formerly _Tabebuia impetiginosa_) is the **national flower of Brazil**, where spectacular avenues lined with these trees create the famous "túneis rosa" (pink tunnels). Brazil also honors the yellow-flowered species as its national tree, reflecting the deep cultural significance of the _Tabebuia_ genus throughout Latin America.

</FeatureBox>

## Conservation Status

<Callout type="info" title="Conservation Notes">
  **IUCN Status**: Least Concern (LC)

While globally secure, local populations of Cortez Negro face pressure from:

- **Selective logging**: Highly valued timber leads to extraction
- **Habitat conversion**: Dry forests being cleared for agriculture
- **Slow growth**: Replacement takes decades

**In Costa Rica**: Protected within national parks and increasingly planted
in urban areas. The species benefits from its popularity as an ornamental,
which helps maintain genetic diversity.
