toxicityDetails: "Seeds and bark contain limonoids (including gedunin and andirobin), intensely bitter compounds that are mildly toxic if consumed in large quantities. The seed oil (andiroba oil) is used medicinally in appropriate doses. The bitterness of the raw seeds naturally deters consumption. No serious poisoning cases have been reported."
skinContactDetails: "No skin irritation from contact with bark, leaves, or sap. Andiroba oil is widely applied topically as a natural insect repellent and anti-inflammatory without adverse reactions."
allergenDetails: "Low allergen risk. Pollen is insect-dispersed and not a significant airborne allergen. Wood dust from milling may cause mild respiratory irritation in sensitized woodworkers, similar to other Meliaceae timbers."
structuralRiskDetails: "Large mature trees may drop heavy branches, especially during storms. The woody fruit capsules (8-12 cm diameter, weighing up to 400 g) fall when ripe and can cause injury. Avoid standing or parking vehicles directly beneath fruiting trees."
safetyNotes: "Cedro Macho is safe for general observation and interaction. Exercise caution under fruiting trees due to falling capsules. The seed oil has a long history of safe topical and medicinal use in Amazonian and Central American traditional medicine."

# Crabwood (Cedro Macho)

<Callout type="tip" title="The Medicinal Timber Giant of the Rainforest">
  **Cedro Macho** (_Carapa guianensis_), known internationally as Crabwood or
  Andiroba, is a towering rainforest tree of the mahogany family (Meliaceae)
  that provides both premium timber and a remarkable medicinal seed oil. Growing
  to 40 meters in Costa Rica's lowland wet forests, this buttressed giant has
  sustained indigenous communities for centuries with its durable wood,
  insect-repellent oil, and anti-inflammatory medicines. As a close relative of
  the celebrated Cedro Amargo (_Cedrela odorata_), Cedro Macho offers similar
  wood quality without the same level of overexploitation.

### Taxonomic Notes

_Carapa guianensis_ is placed in the Meliaceae (mahogany family), which includes many of the world's most valued timber trees: true mahogany (_Swietenia_), cedar (_Cedrela_), and African mahoganies (_Khaya_, _Entandrophragma_). The genus _Carapa_ contains approximately 10 species distributed across the Neotropics and tropical Africa, reflecting an ancient Gondwanan distribution. The common name "Cedro Macho" (Male Cedar) in Costa Rica distinguishes it from _Cedrela odorata_ (Cedro Amargo) — both are Meliaceae, but _Carapa_ lacks the distinctive aromatic wood scent of true cedar.

The genus name _Carapa_ derives from the Carib indigenous name for the tree. The specific epithet _guianensis_ refers to the Guianas (Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana), where the species was first described scientifically.

---

## Physical Description

### Tree Form

Cedro Macho is a large canopy to emergent tree reaching 30–40 m in height in mature forest. The trunk is straight and cylindrical, 60–120 cm in diameter above the buttresses, with well-developed plank buttresses that can extend 1–2 m from the trunk and reach 2–3 m in height. The crown is dense, rounded, and dark green, creating deep shade beneath. The overall form is impressive and monumental, forming a dominant presence in the forest canopy.

### Bark

The outer bark is grayish-brown, rough, and vertically fissured with rectangular plates that flake off with age. The inner bark is pinkish to reddish-brown, with a bitter taste (due to limonoid compounds). The bark is thick (1–2 cm) and provides fire resistance to a degree, though lowland wet forest fires are rare.

### Leaves

Leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, 30–60 cm long, with 4–10 pairs of leaflets plus a terminal leaflet (paripinnate to imparipinnate). Leaflets are oblong to elliptic, 10–20 cm long and 4–7 cm wide, glossy dark green above and paler below, with entire margins and accuminate tips. Young foliage flushes are tinged pink or bronze. The leaf rachis is stout and slightly swollen at the base.

### Flowers

Flowers are small (5–8 mm), cream to yellowish-white, arranged in axillary or sub-terminal panicles 15–30 cm long. Each flower has 4 petals, 8 stamens fused into a staminal tube (characteristic of Meliaceae), and a superior ovary. Flowers are fragrant and primarily pollinated by moths and bees, with flowering occurring in the late dry season (February–April).

### Fruit and Seeds

The fruit is a large, woody, globose capsule, 8–12 cm in diameter, weighing 200–400 g, with 4 valves that split open when ripe on the ground. Each capsule contains 4–16 large, angular, brown seeds, each 3–5 cm across, resembling Brazil nuts in appearance. The seeds are rich in oil (50–60% by weight), which is extracted as the commercially important andiroba oil. Seeds are dispersed by water (they float) and by large rodents (agoutis, pacas) that cache them.

### Root System

The root system features spectacular plank buttresses that provide structural support for the tall trunk in shallow forest soils. Lateral roots extend widely, and the tree forms associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The buttress roots create microhabitats for amphibians, invertebrates, and small mammals.

---

## Geographic Distribution

_Carapa guianensis_ has one of the largest natural distributions of any Neotropical timber tree, ranging from southern Mexico through Central America to the Amazon Basin and the Guianas, and disjunctly in tropical West Africa. In Costa Rica, it occurs in the Caribbean lowlands and the southern Pacific wet lowlands.

/>

### Ecological Role

Cedro Macho is a canopy-dominant species that shapes forest structure in lowland wet forests. Its dense crown provides shade and creates a humid microclimate beneath. Dead and fallen branches contribute to coarse woody debris essential for decomposition cycles. The massive buttress roots create physical structures that influence water flow patterns and provide refugia for forest-floor organisms. The species is an important component of successional forests and riparian corridors.

### Wildlife Interactions

The flowers are visited by moths, bees, and other insects. Seeds are an important food for agoutis (_Dasyprocta punctata_), which also serve as seed dispersers by caching seeds that they fail to retrieve. Pacas, squirrels, and peccaries also consume the seeds. The trees are used as nesting sites by parrots and raptors. The extensive buttress spaces are used by small mammals, amphibians, and reptiles as shelters.

---

## Uses & Applications

### Timber

Cedro Macho produces a medium-weight, moderately hard timber with a warm reddish-brown heartwood and a straight to slightly interlocked grain. The wood works well with both hand and machine tools, takes a good polish, and is naturally durable with moderate resistance to decay and insects. It is used for furniture, cabinetry, interior construction, boat building, plywood, and general carpentry. While not as aromatic or as valued as _Cedrela odorata_ timber, it is a reliable and versatile construction wood.

### Andiroba Oil

The seed oil of _Carapa guianensis_ (andiroba oil or oil of carapa) is one of the most important non-timber forest products (NTFPs) in the Neotropics. The oil is extracted from the fat-rich seeds by pressing or boiling. It has documented anti-inflammatory, analgesic, insect-repellent, and wound-healing properties. In Costa Rica and throughout the Amazon, andiroba oil is applied topically to repel mosquitoes and sandflies, to soothe insect bites and stings, to reduce inflammation from arthritis and sprains, and to treat skin conditions. Modern research has confirmed the bioactivity of the key limonoid compound gedunin.

### Reforestation

Cedro Macho is an increasingly important species for reforestation and agroforestry in Costa Rica's wet lowlands. Its relatively fast establishment, straight trunk form, tolerance of periodic flooding, and valuable timber make it suitable for timber plantations and riparian restoration. Unlike _Cedrela odorata_ and _Swietenia_, _Carapa_ is somewhat less susceptible to the devastating shootborer _Hypsipyla grandella_ (though still affected), making it a more practical choice for plantation forestry.

## Cultural Significance

### Indigenous and Traditional Use

Indigenous peoples throughout the Neotropics have used andiroba oil for millennia. The Bribri and Cabécar of Costa Rica's Caribbean coast use the oil as an insect repellent and anti-inflammatory medicine. In the Amazon, andiroba oil is a household staple, used in candle-making, soap production, and as fuel for lamps. The bitter bark is steeped in alcohol to produce a febrifuge (fever-reducing remedy) used in traditional pharmacopeias across Latin America.

### Economic Importance

Andiroba oil has entered international markets as a natural cosmetic ingredient, appearing in soaps, moisturizers, and massage oils marketed as sustainable Amazonian products. In Costa Rica, small-scale forest-based enterprises collect seeds from natural populations for oil extraction, providing income to rural communities while incentivizing forest conservation. The timber continues to be commercially important, though sustainable harvesting practices are essential.

---

## Conservation Status

_Carapa guianensis_ is assessed as **Least Concern (LC)** on the IUCN Red List due to its wide distribution and relatively large remaining populations. However, local population declines have occurred due to selective logging of the largest trees, deforestation for agriculture, and overexploitation of seed sources for oil production. In Costa Rica, populations in the Osa Peninsula and Caribbean lowlands remain healthy within protected areas, but unprotected forests continue to face pressure.

---

## Cultivation & Care

### Planting

Plant during the onset of the wet season (May–June). Select sites with deep, fertile soils and adequate moisture. Space 12–15 m apart for timber plantations. Young trees tolerate shade and can be interplanted with fast-growing pioneers in enrichment planting schemes. Plant fresh seed directly in the ground or in large nursery bags. No seed pretreatment is needed.

### Watering

Young trees require consistent moisture during the establishment phase (first 2 years). Once established, the deep root system and buttresses provide excellent moisture access. In exceptionally dry years, supplemental irrigation may benefit young plantations.

### Fertilization

Apply balanced organic fertilizer at planting. Annual applications of compost or slow-release fertilizer benefit plantation trees during the first 5 years. Natural forest populations require no fertilization.

### Pruning

For timber production, prune lower branches during the first 10 years to promote a clear, straight trunk of 6–8 m. In natural forest or shade-tree settings, allow natural crown development.

### Companion Planting

- **Beneficial companions**: _Pentaclethra macroloba_ (Gavilán), _Virola koschnyi_ (Fruta Dorada), _Dipteryx panamensis_ (Almendro), palms
- **Compatible understory**: Heliconia spp., Piper spp., shade-tolerant shrubs
- **Avoid**: Aggressive grasses that compete for moisture; do not plant in dry or strongly seasonal climates

### Propagation

Seeds are recalcitrant (they cannot be dried or stored long-term). Collect fallen capsules from the ground, extract seeds, and plant within 1–2 weeks. Sow seeds 2–3 cm deep in moist, well-drained nursery mix or directly in the field. No pretreatment is necessary. Germination occurs in 15–30 days. Transplant nursery seedlings at 30–50 cm height. Seedlings are slow-growing initially but accelerate in the second year.
