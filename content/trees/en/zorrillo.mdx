## Physical & Botanical Description

- Multi-stemmed shrub to small tree, usually **4-8 m** tall.
- Bark gray-brown and relatively smooth when young, becoming fissured with age.
- Leaves are pinnate with opposite leaflets and soft texture.
- Flower clusters are bright yellow and highly visible in open habitats.
- Pods are elongated and contain multiple hard-coated seeds.

In Costa Rica, zorrillo appears mostly in **warm lowland zones**, especially
along river margins, wet pastures, and seasonally flooded edges.

---

## Habitat & Ecology

- Common in riparian corridors, secondary growth, and disturbed wet soils.
- Flowers provide nectar and pollen resources for bees and other insects.
- As a legume, it contributes to nutrient cycling in degraded tropical soils.
- Rapid colonization helps stabilize banks and reduce erosion in flood-prone
  landscapes.

---

## Uses & Applications

### Traditional and practical uses

- Regional medicinal use in decoctions and topical preparations.
- Ornamental planting for long flowering displays.
- Restoration species for humid lowland corridors.
- Temporary shade and wind buffering in mixed agroforestry plots.

### Safety in medicinal context

Traditional use exists, but dosage and preparation quality vary. Professional
medical guidance is essential before internal use.

---

## Conservation Status

**IUCN Red List:** Least Concern (LC).

Although globally stable, local populations can decline where wetlands and
river margins are converted to intensive land uses.

---

## Growing Zorrillo

1. Plant in full sun at rainy-season onset.
2. Keep soils moist during first 12-18 months.
3. Prune lightly after flowering to improve shape and branching.
4. Monitor for drought stress in prolonged dry periods.
5. Renew mulch annually to protect shallow roots.

This species is a practical option for pollinator gardens and ecological
buffer planting in warm, humid regions.

---

## Advanced Care Guidance

### Site Design and Planting

- Establish in full sun with 3-5 m spacing for riparian buffers and flowering
  hedgerows.
- Prioritize deep loam or alluvial soils with good infiltration and seasonal
  moisture.
- In flood-prone areas, plant on slight mounds so roots tolerate high moisture
  without prolonged stagnation.

### Watering Program

- **Establishment (0-6 months):** Deep irrigation 2 times per week in dry
  periods.
- **Juvenile phase (6-24 months):** Irrigate every 7-10 days during intense
  drought windows.
- **Established trees:** Supplemental irrigation only during extended dry spells
  or before peak flowering.

### Fertilization Schedule

- At planting, incorporate compost and rock phosphate to support root
  expansion.
- Apply a light balanced dose (for example 12-12-17) at early and mid rainy
  season during years 1-2.
- Reduce nitrogen-heavy fertilization after establishment because this legume
  already supports nutrient cycling.

### Pruning and Structure

- Perform light pruning after major flowering flushes to maintain a broad,
  stable canopy.
- Remove crossing stems and low weak branches during years 1-3.
- Avoid severe dry-season pruning that can trigger stress and reduced bloom
  performance.

### Pest and Disease Management

- Monitor for caterpillars, scale insects, and sooty mold in humid transitions.
- Improve airflow through selective thinning if foliar fungal spots increase.
- Prioritize sanitation pruning and biological controls before chemical options.

### Companion Planting

- **Recommended companions:** Palma Yolillo, Corozo, Guaba species, and
  pollinator-friendly native shrubs.
- **Agroforestry role:** Rapid nurse canopy and nectar support for restoration
  strips in humid lowlands.
- **Avoid nearby:** Strict dry-forest species that prefer prolonged drought and
  dense turf directly at trunk base.

### Seasonal Care Calendar (Costa Rican Conditions)

- **Dry season (Dec-Apr):** Maintain mulch depth, strategic deep irrigation, and
  drought-stress checks.
- **Early rains (May-Jul):** Main planting window, fertilization, and formative
  pruning.
- **Peak rains (Aug-Oct):** Flood-drainage monitoring and fungal scouting.
- **Transition (Nov):** Soil amendment and irrigation planning for upcoming dry
  months.

### Growth Timeline and Management Notes

- Fast establishment; flowering can begin in years 2-3 under full sun.
- Structural stabilization usually occurs by years 3-4 with regular light
  pruning.
- For restoration uses, integrate with longer-lived native canopy species by
  year 2.

---

## Field Identification and Similar Species

### Fast field cues for zorrillo

- Habit is usually a broad, multi-stemmed shrub-tree rather than a single tall
  forest trunk.
- New leaf flush tends to be soft-textured and light green, then darkens quickly
  with moisture and sun.
- Flowering often appears as conspicuous yellow clusters held above surrounding
  wetland herbs and grasses.
- Pods are narrow and elongated, hanging in clusters after flowering flushes.
- In open wet sites, crowns are rounded and visibly denser on the sun-facing
  side.

/>

### Practical verification protocol

1. Confirm wet-site context (riparian edge, floodplain margin, or moist pasture
   edge).
2. Check pinnate leaf structure and compare leaflet shape against verified photo
   references.
3. Record flower and pod stage if present; these reproductive details reduce
   misidentification risk.
4. Document canopy habit and bark appearance from at least two angles.
5. When uncertain, cross-check with iNaturalist observations from the same
   region and season.

## Restoration and Management Playbook

### Riparian buffer installation

- Use zorrillo as an early-structure species on upper riverbank benches and
  floodplain shoulders.
- Combine with deeper-rooted longer-lived trees so canopy function persists
  after pioneer phases.
- Keep grass suppression rings during years 1-2 to reduce dry-season mortality.
- Replace failed individuals quickly in first rainy season to keep buffer
  continuity.

### Wet pasture conversion strips

- Plant in staggered rows rather than a single line to improve wind resistance
  and pollen flow.
- Use short-term fencing when livestock pressure is high during establishment.
- Maintain visible maintenance lanes for inspection and targeted pruning access.
- Pair with native shrubs that attract pollinators to increase ecological
  function beyond erosion control.

### Urban and peri-urban rain-garden use

- Place away from narrow drainage inlets that clog with leaf litter.
- Maintain modest crown size through light cyclical post-bloom pruning.
- Keep educational signage that clarifies medicinal caution and low-toxicity but
  non-edible status.
- Prioritize sites where seasonal moisture can be retained without chronic root
  stagnation.

### Integration with mixed native corridors

- Use zorrillo as a 2- to 8-year accelerator species while slower canopy trees
  establish.
- Introduce late-successional companions once zorrillo provides partial shade and
  cooler soil.
- Schedule thinning only where zorrillo suppresses target long-lived natives.
- Preserve some flowering individuals as perennial pollinator anchors in each
  restoration cell.
