## Physical & Botanical Description

- Multi-stemmed shrub to small tree, usually **4-8 m** tall.
- Bark gray-brown and relatively smooth when young, becoming fissured with age.
- Leaves are pinnate with opposite leaflets and soft texture.
- Flower clusters are bright yellow and highly visible in open habitats.
- Pods are elongated and contain multiple hard-coated seeds.

In Costa Rica, zorrillo appears mostly in **warm lowland zones**, especially
along river margins, wet pastures, and seasonally flooded edges.

---

## Habitat & Ecology

- Common in riparian corridors, secondary growth, and disturbed wet soils.
- Flowers provide nectar and pollen resources for bees and other insects.
- As a legume, it contributes to nutrient cycling in degraded tropical soils.
- Rapid colonization helps stabilize banks and reduce erosion in flood-prone
  landscapes.

---

## Uses & Applications

### Traditional and practical uses

- Regional medicinal use in decoctions and topical preparations.
- Ornamental planting for long flowering displays.
- Restoration species for humid lowland corridors.
- Temporary shade and wind buffering in mixed agroforestry plots.

### Safety in medicinal context

Traditional use exists, but dosage and preparation quality vary. Professional
medical guidance is essential before internal use.

---

## Conservation Status

**IUCN Red List:** Least Concern (LC).

Although globally stable, local populations can decline where wetlands and
river margins are converted to intensive land uses.

---

## Growing Zorrillo

1. Plant in full sun at rainy-season onset.
2. Keep soils moist during first 12-18 months.
3. Prune lightly after flowering to improve shape and branching.
4. Monitor for drought stress in prolonged dry periods.
5. Renew mulch annually to protect shallow roots.

This species is a practical option for pollinator gardens and ecological
buffer planting in warm, humid regions.

---

## Advanced Care Guidance

### Site Design and Planting

- Establish in full sun with 3-5 m spacing for riparian buffers and flowering
  hedgerows.
- Prioritize deep loam or alluvial soils with good infiltration and seasonal
  moisture.
- In flood-prone areas, plant on slight mounds so roots tolerate high moisture
  without prolonged stagnation.

### Watering Program

- **Establishment (0-6 months):** Deep irrigation 2 times per week in dry
  periods.
- **Juvenile phase (6-24 months):** Irrigate every 7-10 days during intense
  drought windows.
- **Established trees:** Supplemental irrigation only during extended dry spells
  or before peak flowering.

### Fertilization Schedule

- At planting, incorporate compost and rock phosphate to support root
  expansion.
- Apply a light balanced dose (for example 12-12-17) at early and mid rainy
  season during years 1-2.
- Reduce nitrogen-heavy fertilization after establishment because this legume
  already supports nutrient cycling.

### Pruning and Structure

- Perform light pruning after major flowering flushes to maintain a broad,
  stable canopy.
- Remove crossing stems and low weak branches during years 1-3.
- Avoid severe dry-season pruning that can trigger stress and reduced bloom
  performance.

### Pest and Disease Management

- Monitor for caterpillars, scale insects, and sooty mold in humid transitions.
- Improve airflow through selective thinning if foliar fungal spots increase.
- Prioritize sanitation pruning and biological controls before chemical options.

### Companion Planting

- **Recommended companions:** Palma Yolillo, Corozo, Guaba species, and
  pollinator-friendly native shrubs.
- **Agroforestry role:** Rapid nurse canopy and nectar support for restoration
  strips in humid lowlands.
- **Avoid nearby:** Strict dry-forest species that prefer prolonged drought and
  dense turf directly at trunk base.

### Seasonal Care Calendar (Costa Rican Conditions)

- **Dry season (Dec-Apr):** Maintain mulch depth, strategic deep irrigation, and
  drought-stress checks.
- **Early rains (May-Jul):** Main planting window, fertilization, and formative
  pruning.
- **Peak rains (Aug-Oct):** Flood-drainage monitoring and fungal scouting.
- **Transition (Nov):** Soil amendment and irrigation planning for upcoming dry
  months.

### Growth Timeline and Management Notes

- Fast establishment; flowering can begin in years 2-3 under full sun.
- Structural stabilization usually occurs by years 3-4 with regular light
  pruning.
- For restoration uses, integrate with longer-lived native canopy species by
  year 2.

## Where to See Zorrillo in Costa Rica

- **Caño Negro Wildlife Refuge** floodplain edges.
- **Tortuguero lowland corridors** and wet secondary growth.
- **Tempisque basin wetlands** in Guanacaste.
- **Sarapiqui river landscapes** in mixed-use farms and forest margins.
