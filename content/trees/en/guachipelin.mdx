toxicityDetails: "Guachipelín is NON-TOXIC with NO documented reports of toxicity or danger to children, pets, or livestock. The bark contains tannins, alkaloids, and flavonoids that provide medicinal properties (anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antioxidant) but these do not pose poisoning risk in normal circumstances. Seeds, bark, and leaves are not described as poisonous or problematic for animals or people. The tree is SAFE for gardens, parks, farms, and areas where children and pets are present. Widely used for living fences throughout Costa Rica, demonstrating general safety in agricultural and landscape settings where livestock and people interact with it daily."
skinContactDetails: "No skin irritation risk from contact with any part of the tree. Leaves, bark, flowers, and sap do not cause dermatitis or allergic reactions. Safe to handle and work with. The durable, rot-resistant wood is widely used for fence posts with no reports of skin reactions during handling or cutting."
allergenDetails: "NO allergen risk. Flowers are bee-pollinated (excellent for beekeepers and honey production), not wind-pollinated, so no airborne pollen concerns. Wood dust is not documented as a respiratory sensitizer or allergen. Safe for woodworkers without special respiratory precautions beyond normal dust control. Birds and wildlife are attracted to flowers and seeds with no adverse effects."
safetyNotes: "Guachipelín is an EXCEPTIONALLY SAFE and VALUABLE tree for all settings. ZERO toxicity concerns for children, pets, or livestock. TRADITIONAL MEDICINE: The bark is used to treat headaches, fever, inflammation, arthritis, and dysentery, demonstrating centuries of safe use at appropriate dosages. NITROGEN-FIXING LEGUME: Improves soil fertility, making it valuable for ecological restoration and soil management. LIVING FENCES: Widely used in Costa Rica for property boundaries - propagates easily from cuttings. WOOD: Extremely durable and rot-resistant, perfect for fence posts, construction, firewood. ECOLOGICAL VALUE: Supports bees, birds, and wildlife. Perfect choice for farms, reforestation projects, living fences, and ornamental planting. The spectacular golden-yellow flowers are safe and beautiful."

# Guachipelín (Yellow Flowering Acacia)

<Callout type="success" title="Golden Glory of Guanacaste">
  The **Guachipelín** (_Diphysa americana_) is one of the most celebrated
  flowering trees of Costa Rica's dry forests. When these small trees burst into
  bloom during the dry season, entire hillsides become rivers of gold. The wood
  is legendary among farmers for making fence posts that last decades without
  rotting.

## Ecological Importance

### Dry Forest Ecosystem Role

<Callout type="warning" title="Key Dry Season Resource">
  Guachipelín flowering during the dry season provides critical nectar for bees
  and other pollinators when few other plants are blooming. As a nitrogen-fixing
  legume, it also enriches poor soils common in Guanacaste's dry forests.
</Callout>

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Pollinator Services

- **Native bees**: Primary pollinators
- **Honey bees**: Important nectar source
- **Butterflies**: Regular visitors
- **Hummingbirds**: Occasional visitors

</Column>
<Column>

#### Soil Benefits

- Nitrogen fixation via root nodules
- Leaf litter enriches soil
- Deep roots access groundwater
- Erosion control on slopes

</Column>

  Guachipelín wood is so resistant to decay that fence posts made from it can
  last 25-30 years in the ground—an incredible feat in tropical conditions where
  most wood rots within a few years. This has made it one of the most valued
  trees for rural landowners.

## Interesting Facts

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="💛 Rivers of Gold">

When Guachipelín trees bloom en masse, entire hillsides in Guanacaste appear to
flow with liquid gold. This spectacular display occurs during the driest,
hottest months when most other vegetation is brown and dormant, making the
contrast even more dramatic. Local festivals sometimes coincide with peak
flowering.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🪵 The 30-Year Post">

Local farmers say a Guachipelín fence post "will outlast the man who planted
it." This isn't much of an exaggeration—properly prepared posts can indeed last
25-30 years in the ground. The wood contains natural compounds that resist
fungi and termites, making it invaluable before modern treated posts existed.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="💨 Balloon Seeds">

The distinctive inflated seed pods act like little balloons, helping seeds
disperse on the wind. When dry, they can also roll across the ground, further
spreading seeds. This ingenious adaptation helps the tree colonize new areas
after disturbances.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🐝 Bee Tree">

Beekeepers in Guanacaste treasure Guachipelín as one of their most reliable
honey sources. The abundant flowers produce nectar during the dry season when
other sources are scarce, helping maintain bee colonies through the difficult
months before the rainy season.

## Cultural Significance

<Callout type="leaf" title="The Farmer's Tree">
  In Guanacaste, the Guachipelín holds a special place in rural culture. For
  generations, it has been the go-to tree for fence posts—a critical resource in
  cattle country where fences define property boundaries and contain livestock.
  The local saying "posts de guachipelín duran más que el que los puso"
  (guachipelín posts last longer than the person who planted them) speaks to
  both the wood's durability and the tree's deep integration into ranching
  culture.
</Callout>

<FeatureBox icon="🏆" title="The Guachipelín Adventure Park" variant="highlight">

The tree's name has become synonymous with adventure tourism in Costa Rica. The famous **Hacienda Guachipelín** near Rincón de la Vieja volcano takes its name from these trees that dot the property. Today, visitors can zipline, horseback ride, and hike among groves of these golden-flowering trees—a fitting tribute to a species so central to Guanacaste's identity.
