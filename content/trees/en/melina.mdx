# Gmelina

<Callout type="success" title="The Speed Champion">
  **Gmelina** (_Gmelina arborea_), known locally as **Melina**, is one of the
  world's fastest-growing trees, capable of producing harvestable timber in just
  5-8 years. This remarkable growth rate has made it a cornerstone of Costa
  Rica's plantation forestry industry, providing sustainable wood for pulp,
  construction, and furniture.

<AccordionItem title="🔬 Taxonomic Notes">

Like teak, Gmelina belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae). The genus was named after German botanist Johann Georg Gmelin. About 35 species exist in the genus, but _G. arborea_ is by far the most commercially important.

**Not True Teak**: Despite being called "White Teak" in some markets, Gmelina is not related to true teak beyond being in the same family. Its wood properties are quite different.

**Growth Record**: Under optimal conditions, Gmelina can grow 3-5 meters per year in height, making it one of the fastest-growing hardwoods in the world.

<Callout type="success" title="The Fast-Track Forester">

_Gmelina arborea represents the promise of sustainable plantation forestry.
Its remarkable growth rate means that demand for wood products can be met
without further depleting natural forests. While not a replacement for
native ecosystem conservation, Gmelina plantations in Costa Rica demonstrate
how agricultural land can produce valuable timber while reducing pressure
on primary forests._
