# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "none"
toxicParts: []
skinContactRisk: "none"
allergenRisk: "low"
structuralRisks:
  - "falling-branches"
  - "aggressive-roots"
childSafe: true
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "Gmelina (Melina) is non-toxic and safe around humans and animals. No parts of this tree are poisonous. It has been widely planted in tropical regions worldwide for decades without toxicity issues. Safe for use in landscapes, plantations, and reforestation projects. Animals can graze near these trees without risk."
skinContactDetails: "No known skin irritation risks. The tree does not produce caustic sap or irritating compounds. Wood dust during milling may cause mechanical irritation (use standard protective equipment when sawing), but the living tree poses no dermal hazards. Safe to handle and touch."
allergenDetails: "Pollen during flowering may cause minor seasonal allergies in sensitive individuals. Wood dust may cause respiratory irritation during processing (use dust masks). Overall allergen risk is low to moderate during peak flowering, low otherwise."
structuralRiskDetails: "Fast-growing tree reaching 25-35 meters. Rapid growth can lead to weaker wood structure compared to slow-growing hardwoods. Branches may be more prone to breakage in storms. Root system can be aggressive and may lift pavement or interfere with nearby structures. Plant with adequate space. Consider this a moderate-maintenance tree requiring appropriate placement."
safetyNotes: "Melina is safe from a toxicity perspective and suitable for properties, plantations, and public areas. The tree's rapid growth is both an advantage (quick shade, fast timber production) and a consideration (structural maintenance needed). Main safety considerations are structural rather than chemical: fast growth can mean weaker branches, and aggressive roots need space. Overall, a safe tree when properly sited."
wildlifeRisks: "Safe for wildlife and livestock. Birds use the tree for nesting. No toxic effects on animals."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "very fast"
growthRateDetails: "6-10 ft/year; one of fastest-growing timber species; reaches 15-20m in 7-10 years"
matureSize: "25-35 m tall (often harvested at 15-20m for timber at 8-12 years), crown spread 10-15 m"
hardiness: "Humid tropical lowlands; optimal 0-800m elevation; requires consistent rainfall"
soilRequirements: "Prefers deep, fertile, well-drained soils; pH 5-7; tolerates acidic soils; does NOT thrive in poor, shallow, or waterlogged soils"
waterNeeds: "high"
waterDetails: "High water needs - NOT drought-tolerant. Requires 1800-3500mm annual rainfall or supplemental irrigation. Young plantations need consistent moisture. Tree slows growth significantly during dry periods. Best in areas with short dry season or year-round rain. Popular in Caribbean lowlands and Pacific south zone."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Commercial plantations: 3x3m (1100 trees/ha) or 4x4m (625 trees/ha); ornamental: 10-12 m from structures"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
  - "cuttings"
  - "tissue culture"
propagationDifficulty: "easy"
plantingSeason: "Plant at start of rainy season (May-June) for best establishment"
maintenanceNeeds: "MODERATE to HIGH maintenance for commercial plantations. Year 1-2: Weed control CRITICAL - melina suffers severely from grass competition. Fertilize at planting (NPK 10-30-10) and again at 6 months. Monitor for termites and fungal diseases. Years 3-5: Continue weed suppression until canopy closes. May need thinning at year 3-4 (remove 30-40% of trees to improve growth of remaining crop). Pruning lower branches improves log quality. Years 6-12: Harvest rotation. Minimal maintenance once canopy established. CHALLENGE: Aggressive root system and allelopathy suppress understory - difficult to establish other crops nearby. COMMERCIAL NOTE: Popular for plantation forestry due to extremely fast growth, but requires fertile soils and good management. Not suitable for degraded land restoration without inputs."
commonProblems:
  - "Grass competition severely stunts young trees - aggressive weed control first 2 years essential"
  - "Termite damage in some areas - treat stumps, monitor plantations"
  - "Heart rot fungus (Phellinus gilvus) in older trees - affects wood quality"
  - "Root disease (Rosellinia) in wet sites - avoid waterlogged soils"
  - "Aggressive roots may damage nearby infrastructure - plant away from buildings/roads"
  - "Allelopathy inhibits growth of crops planted underneath - not ideal for agroforestry with understory crops"
  - "Wind breakage in exposed sites - plant in blocks for mutual protection"

# Gmelina

<Callout type="success" title="The Speed Champion">
  **Gmelina** (_Gmelina arborea_), known locally as **Melina**, is one of the
  world's fastest-growing trees, capable of producing harvestable timber in just
  5-8 years. This remarkable growth rate has made it a cornerstone of Costa
  Rica's plantation forestry industry, providing sustainable wood for pulp,
  construction, and furniture.

<AccordionItem title="🔬 Taxonomic Notes">

Like teak, Gmelina belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae). The genus was named after German botanist Johann Georg Gmelin. About 35 species exist in the genus, but _G. arborea_ is by far the most commercially important.

**Not True Teak**: Despite being called "White Teak" in some markets, Gmelina is not related to true teak beyond being in the same family. Its wood properties are quite different.

**Growth Record**: Under optimal conditions, Gmelina can grow 3-5 meters per year in height, making it one of the fastest-growing hardwoods in the world.

_Gmelina arborea represents the promise of sustainable plantation forestry.
Its remarkable growth rate means that demand for wood products can be met
without further depleting natural forests. While not a replacement for
native ecosystem conservation, Gmelina plantations in Costa Rica demonstrate
how agricultural land can produce valuable timber while reducing pressure
on primary forests._
