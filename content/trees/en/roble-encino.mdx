# Roble Encino (Highland Oak)

<Callout type="success" title="Monarchs of the Cloud Forest">
  The **Highland Oaks** (_Quercus_ spp.) are the defining trees of Costa Rica's
  mountain forests. These majestic trees create unique ecosystems that support
  the famous Resplendent Quetzal and countless other species found nowhere else
  on Earth.

<AccordionItem title="🔬 Taxonomic Notes">

Costa Rican oaks belong primarily to the red oak section (Lobatae) of genus _Quercus_. They represent the southernmost distribution of oaks in the Americas, with several endemic species found only in Central American highlands.

**Endemic Species**: Several Costa Rican oak species are endemic to the region, including _Q. copeyensis_ and _Q. costaricensis_.

**Evolutionary Significance**: These oaks represent an ancient lineage that migrated south when North and South America connected, adapting to highland conditions.

  Cloud forests are particularly vulnerable to climate change. As temperatures
  rise, the cloud base moves upward, potentially leaving oak forests without
  their characteristic moisture regime. This threatens both the trees and the
