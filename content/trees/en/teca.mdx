# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "none"
toxicParts: []
skinContactRisk: "low"
allergenRisk: "high"
childSafe: true
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "The living tree is non-toxic. All parts including leaves, flowers, and seeds are safe if ingested in normal amounts. However, teak is well-known for causing significant occupational health issues in woodworkers."
skinContactDetails: "Fresh plant parts generally safe. Some individuals may experience mild skin irritation from leaves or sap. Wood sawdust can cause dermatitis in sensitive individuals."
allergenDetails: "WOOD DUST HAZARD: Teak wood dust is a potent respiratory sensitizer and allergen. Woodworkers commonly develop allergic reactions including asthma, rhinitis, and dermatitis. Dust contains quinones (tectoquinone) that cause sensitization. Long-term exposure can lead to chronic respiratory issues. Proper dust collection and respiratory protection REQUIRED when working with teak wood. Not a concern for living tree."
safetyNotes: "The living teak tree is safe for landscaping and poses no toxicity risk to children or pets. Can be planted in residential areas without concern. However, anyone working with teak WOOD (sawing, sanding, carving) must use proper dust control and respiratory protection due to high allergenicity of the wood dust. This is an occupational health concern for carpenters, not a concern for people around living trees."
wildlifeRisks: "Safe for wildlife and livestock. Leaves are browsed by deer and livestock without harm."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "fast"
growthRateDetails: "3-5 ft/year in optimal conditions; reaches 25m in 20-25 years; commercial harvest at 20-30 years"
matureSize: "30-45 m tall, trunk diameter 1-1.5 m, crown spread 15-20 m"
hardiness: "Tropical; 0-800m elevation; requires distinct dry season (4-5 months); sensitive to frost"
soilRequirements: "Prefers deep, well-drained volcanic or alluvial soils; pH 6.0-7.5; does poorly in heavy clay or waterlogged soils"
waterNeeds: "moderate"
waterDetails: "Requires 1200-2500mm annual rainfall with distinct dry season. Water young trees during first dry season. Established trees tolerate drought during dry season (actually improves wood quality). Too much water year-round produces inferior wood."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plantation spacing: 2.5-3m x 2.5-3m for timber production; ornamental planting: 10-15m from buildings"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
  - "tissue-culture"
propagationDifficulty: "moderate"
plantingSeason: "Start of rainy season (May-June) critical for establishment"
maintenanceNeeds: "MODERATE to HIGH for plantation timber, LOW for ornamental. TIMBER PRODUCTION: Years 1-5: weed control critical (teak grows poorly with competition), apply fertilizer years 1-3 if needed, prune lower branches at year 3-5 to produce clear bole. Years 5-10: thin plantation to 400-500 trees/hectare, prune to 6m height for valuable clear lumber. Years 10-20: second thinning to 200-250 trees/hectare, selective pruning. Years 20-30: harvest. ORNAMENTAL: Minimal care needed—water young tree first 2 years, remove dead branches, allow natural form to develop. No fertilization needed for ornamental trees."
commonProblems:
  - "Teak skeletonizer caterpillar (Eutectona machaeralis) defoliates trees - usually recovers, biological control available"
  - "Poor growth in heavy clay or waterlogged soils - ensure good drainage"
  - "Slow growth without dry season - requires seasonal drought for quality wood"
  - "Leaf rust fungus in excessively humid conditions - ensure good spacing and air flow"
  - "Shoot borer (Hypsipyla robusta) attacks young trees - prune out damaged shoots, healthy trees recover"
  - "Weeds compete strongly with young teak - weed control years 1-3 is critical"

# Teak

<Callout type="success" title="The King of Tropical Hardwoods">
  **Teak** (_Tectona grandis_) is arguably the world's most prized tropical
  hardwood, renowned for its exceptional durability, natural resistance to rot
  and insects, and beautiful golden-brown color. Though native to Asia, Costa
  Rica has become a major producer of plantation teak, with extensive forests in
  Guanacaste and the Northern Zone.

<AccordionItem title="🔬 Taxonomic Notes">

Surprisingly, teak belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae), not a typical timber tree family. The genus _Tectona_ contains only 3 species, with _T. grandis_ being by far the most important commercially.

**Origins**: Teak is native to India, Myanmar, Thailand, and Laos. It was introduced to Costa Rica in the 1920s and has since become one of the country's most important plantation species.

**Plantation Industry**: Costa Rica is now one of the world's leading teak producers, with over 60,000 hectares under cultivation, primarily in Guanacaste and the Northern Zone.

_Teak (Tectona grandis) represents the pinnacle of tropical hardwoods—its
combination of beauty, durability, and workability is unmatched. While wild
populations are endangered in Asia, Costa Rica's sustainable plantations
demonstrate how responsible forestry can meet global demand while creating
economic opportunity. Every teak deck and piece of outdoor furniture from Costa
Rica represents a renewable harvest rather than forest destruction._
