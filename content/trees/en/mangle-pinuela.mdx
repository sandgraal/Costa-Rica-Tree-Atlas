# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "low"
toxicParts:
  - "leaves (tannins)"
skinContactRisk: "none"
allergenRisk: "low"
structuralRisks:
  - "prop-roots"
  - "slippery-substrate"
childSafe: true
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "Tea mangrove leaves contain tannins and related compounds that give them astringent properties. The common name comes from historical use of leaves as tea substitute. Not toxic to humans - leaves have been used for centuries in traditional preparations. Tannin content may cause mild stomach upset if consumed in very large quantities."
skinContactDetails: "Completely safe for skin contact. No irritation from leaves, bark, flowers, or sap. The cone-shaped adventitious roots and bark are safe to touch. No reports of dermatitis or skin sensitivity."
allergenDetails: "Low allergen risk. Large showy flowers produce nectar for hummingbirds and bats. Pollen production is moderate. No significant reports of allergic reactions in humans."
structuralRiskDetails: "The distinctive cone-shaped base formed by layers of adventitious roots can be uneven to walk around. Roots may be slippery when wet. Growing in tidal areas means substrate is typically muddy and unstable. Stay on designated paths. CRITICAL: This is a rare, vulnerable species - avoid damaging roots or disturbing habitat."
safetyNotes: "Tea mangrove is a safe species but CRITICALLY IMPORTANT for conservation. Protected species throughout its range. DO NOT harvest, damage, or disturb. Essential habitat for the endangered Mangrove Hummingbird (Amazilia boucardi). Report sightings to conservation authorities. Observe from a distance without disturbing."
wildlifeRisks: "Safe and vitally important for wildlife. Primary nectar source for endangered Mangrove Hummingbird. Flowers also visited by bats (pollinators). Not toxic to any wildlife. Critical component of Pacific coastal biodiversity."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "slow"
growthRateDetails: "Slower than other mangrove species; rare in cultivation due to conservation status"
matureSize: "15-20 m tall (50-65 ft), distinctive cone-shaped base; rarely reaches maximum height"
hardiness: "Restricted to Pacific coastal brackish zones 0-3m elevation; specific salinity requirements; highly sensitive to disturbance"
soilRequirements: "Requires specific brackish water conditions; lower salinity than red/black mangroves (8-15 ppt optimal); anaerobic substrates"
waterNeeds: "very-high"
waterDetails: "Requires tidal inundation in brackish zones. Less salt-tolerant than other mangroves - prefers salinity 8-15 ppt. Cannot survive in high-salinity conditions or dry conditions. Restricted to specific tidal zones where freshwater mixes with seawater."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "DO NOT CULTIVATE - protected species. Only conservation restoration projects with permits"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
propagationDifficulty: "very difficult"
plantingSeason: "Protected species - only authorized conservation projects"
maintenanceNeeds: "NOT FOR GENERAL CULTIVATION. Tea mangrove is a vulnerable species requiring specialized care and legal permits for any propagation. Conservation restoration projects only. Requires: (1) Protected habitat in natural brackish zones, (2) Specific salinity conditions (8-15 ppt), (3) Legal permits and conservation authority coordination, (4) Mangrove hummingbird habitat protection, (5) Monitoring for climate change impacts, (6) Protection from coastal development. IF YOU ENCOUNTER: Document location, photograph without disturbing, report to SINAC or conservation organizations."
commonProblems:
  - "CRITICAL: Habitat loss from coastal development - primary threat"
  - "Sea level rise altering suitable salinity zones"
  - "Competition from more salt-tolerant mangrove species"
  - "Small, isolated populations with limited gene flow"
  - "Climate change impacts on brackish zone extent"
  - "Loss of mangrove hummingbird pollinator"
  - "Illegal harvest or disturbance"
  - "Coastal pollution and water quality degradation"

# Tea Mangrove (Mangle Piñuela)

<Callout type="warning" title="Rare and Endangered Pacific Endemic">
  **Tea Mangrove** (_Pelliciera rhizophorae_) is the rarest of all true mangrove
  species, found only along a narrow strip of the Pacific coast from Nicaragua to
  Ecuador. This ancient lineage—a living fossil—faces extinction due to habitat
  loss and climate change. Its survival is intimately linked with the endangered
  **Mangrove Hummingbird**, which depends on its spectacular flowers for nectar.

## Physical Description

### General Form

Tea Mangrove is instantly recognizable by its distinctive **cone-shaped base** formed by layers of adventitious roots that create a spongy, corky structure. This adaptation is unique among mangroves and crucial for gas exchange in anaerobic soils. The tree typically grows to medium height with a relatively narrow crown and large, leathery leaves.

### Habitat Requirements

<SimpleList
  items={[
    "Elevation: Sea level to 3 m (specific tidal zones)",
    "Salinity: 8-15 ppt (LOWER than other mangroves)",
    "Zone: Brackish water where fresh water mixes with seawater",

    "Temperature: 24-30°C",
    "Substrate: Anaerobic mud",
    "Competition: Outcompeted by Rhizophora in higher salinity",
    "Light: Full sun required",
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="warning" title="Why So Rare?">
  Tea mangrove's rarity is due to: - **Narrow niche**: Requires specific salinity
  (8-15 ppt) - **Competition**: Outcompeted by more salt-tolerant species -
  **Habitat loss**: Coastal development destroys brackish zones - **Climate
  change**: Sea level rise alters salinity patterns - **Small populations**:
  Isolated stands with poor gene flow - **Ancient decline**: Was more widespread
  in geological past

## Ecological Importance

### A Critical Wildlife Partnership

<FeatureBox title="The Mangrove Hummingbird Connection" icon="🐦">
  Tea mangrove and the **Mangrove Hummingbird** (_Amazilia boucardi_) share an
  intimate ecological relationship: **The Hummingbird**: - Endemic to Pacific
  Costa Rica - Endangered species - Depends on tea mangrove flowers for food -
  Range closely matches tea mangrove distribution **The Partnership**: - Large
  flowers produce abundant nectar - Bloom period coincides with hummingbird
  breeding - Hummingbirds are primary pollinators - Also pollinated by bats at
  night **Conservation Implication**: - Protecting tea mangrove protects
  hummingbird - Loss of either species threatens the other - Joint conservation
  efforts essential
</FeatureBox>

### Ecosystem Role

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Wildlife Support

- **Primary**: Mangrove Hummingbird nectar source
- **Bats**: Nighttime pollination
- **Fish**: Juvenile habitat in root zone
- **Crabs**: Forage in leaf litter
- **Insects**: Various pollinators and herbivores
- **Birds**: Nesting and perching

</Column>
<Column>

#### Coastal Function

- **Erosion control**: Root systems stabilize soil
- **Storm buffering**: Reduces wave energy
- **Carbon storage**: Biomass and peat accumulation
- **Water filtration**: Improves coastal water quality
- **Habitat structure**: Adds diversity to mangrove zones
- **Genetic reservoir**: Ancient lineage biodiversity

<Callout type="success" title="A Living Fossil Worth Saving">
  The Tea Mangrove is more than a rare tree—it's a window into ancient mangrove
  evolution, a critical habitat for endangered wildlife, and a symbol of the
  fragility of coastal ecosystems. Every individual matters. Every stand is
  precious. From its distinctive cone-shaped base to its spectacular flowers that
  feed the equally rare Mangrove Hummingbird, Pelliciera rhizophorae reminds us
  that some of nature's most extraordinary adaptations hang by a thread.
  Protecting this species means protecting the brackish tidal zones where fresh
  water meets the sea, where carbon is stored, where storms are buffered, and
  where evolution's ancient experiments continue. Let's not let millions of years
  of adaptation disappear on our watch.
