# Caobilla

<Callout type="success" title="The Medicine Tree of the Rainforest">
  **Caobilla** (_Carapa guianensis_), also known as **Andiroba** or
  **Crabwood**, is a remarkable rainforest tree prized for both its
  mahogany-like timber and its oil-rich seeds. Indigenous peoples have extracted
  medicinal oil from its nuts for centuries, while its durable wood remains
  highly valued for construction and furniture.

<AccordionItem title="🔬 Taxonomic Notes">

_Carapa_ is a small genus of about 10 species in the mahogany family (Meliaceae). The species epithet _guianensis_ refers to the Guiana region of South America where it was first scientifically described.

**Related Species**: _C. procera_ occurs in West Africa (remarkable transatlantic distribution). In Costa Rica, Caobilla is related to true Mahogany (_Swietenia_) and Cedar (_Cedrela_).

**Oil Quality**: The seed oil (Andiroba oil) is one of the most valued non-timber forest products from Amazonian forests, rivaling Brazil nut oil in economic importance.

<Callout type="success" title="The Tree of Dual Value">

_The Caobilla (Carapa guianensis) exemplifies sustainable forest use—its timber provides durable wood comparable to mahogany, while its seeds yield medicinal oil that can be harvested without harming the tree. In an era seeking alternatives to destructive logging, this wetland species offers a model for balancing conservation with economic development._
