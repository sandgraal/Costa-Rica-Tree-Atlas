toxicityDetails: "WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS TREE. All parts contain extremely toxic phorbol esters. The fruit resembles small green apples ('manzanilla de la muerte' = little apple of death) but causes immediate burning, blistering of mouth and throat, severe vomiting, diarrhea, and can be FATAL if swallowed. Even a small bite causes excruciating pain. Contains hippomane A and B - potent toxins that cause severe gastrointestinal damage and can lead to death. Historical records document numerous fatal poisonings from eating the fruit. Indigenous Caribs used crushed fruit as poison on arrow tips."
skinContactDetails: "The milky sap is EXTREMELY CAUSTIC and causes immediate severe chemical burns, painful blistering, and dermatitis on contact. Eye contact causes temporary or permanent blindness with severe corneal damage. Standing under the tree during rain causes burns as rainwater washes toxins onto skin - burns develop within minutes. Even touching the bark can cause skin reactions. Smoke from burning wood causes severe respiratory distress, eye inflammation, and temporary blindness. Spanish conquistadors reportedly used the smoke as a form of torture. Never touch any part of this tree."
allergenDetails: "Sap particles and pollen are highly irritating. Proximity to the tree can cause respiratory irritation in sensitive individuals. Wood dust from cutting (done only by professionals with full protective gear) causes severe respiratory reactions."
structuralRiskDetails: "Branches can drop without warning, particularly during storms. Falling fruit poses additional risk as it spreads toxic sap on impact. The tree is often found on beaches where unsuspecting tourists encounter it."
safetyNotes: "This tree is marked with WARNING SIGNS in many locations (red X painted on trunk, warning placards). NEVER touch, eat, stand under, or burn this tree. The fruit looks like small green apples but is DEADLY - one bite can kill a child. Caribbean beaches often have warning signs. Indigenous peoples were well aware of its dangers and used it as a weapon. Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León was reportedly killed by a Manchineel-poisoned arrow. The tree should NEVER be planted near public areas, homes, or where children play. Some countries have laws requiring warning signs. If you see this tree, keep children and pets far away and warn others."
wildlifeRisks: "Fruit is toxic to most mammals including all domestic animals (dogs, cats, horses, livestock). However, some specialized animals like iguanas and land crabs can eat the fruit safely. Birds may perch safely in branches. Keep all pets away from this tree."

# Manchineel (Beach Apple)

<Callout type="danger" title="⛔ EXTREME DANGER: World's Most Dangerous Tree">
  The **Manchineel** (_Hippomane mancinella_), also known as **Beach Apple** or
  **Manzanillo de la Muerte** (Little Apple of Death), is widely recognized as
  the **most dangerous tree in the world**. It appears in the **Guinness Book of
  World Records** as "the world's most dangerous tree." Every single part—fruit,
  leaves, bark, sap—is **highly toxic and caustic**. The fruit resembles small
  green apples but is **LETHALLY POISONOUS**. Standing under the tree during
  rain causes **severe chemical burns**. This tree has **killed and injured
  countless people** throughout history and continues to pose extreme danger,

## Why Is This Tree So Dangerous?

### The "Apple of Death"

The fruit is the source of most poisonings:

- **Appearance**: Resembles small green apples (2-4 cm diameter)
- **Smell**: Sweet, pleasant aroma that attracts victims
- **Taste**: Initially sweet, then immediate burning
- **Toxicity**: Even one bite can be fatal to children
- **Mechanism**: Contains phorbol esters that cause severe tissue damage

### The Caustic Sap

The milky latex is one of nature's most potent irritants:

- **Contact**: Causes immediate chemical burns and blistering
- **Rain**: Standing under tree during rain = severe burns from runoff
- **Smoke**: Burning the wood releases toxic fumes causing blindness
- **Duration**: Burns can last weeks and may scar permanently

### Historical Significance

- **Indigenous Use**: Caribs poisoned arrow tips with sap and crushed fruit
- **Juan Ponce de León**: Spanish explorer killed by Manchineel-poisoned arrow in 1521
- **Shipwreck Survivors**: Historical accounts of castaways dying from eating the fruit
- **Torture**: Spanish conquistadors reportedly used smoke as a torture method

## Physical Description
