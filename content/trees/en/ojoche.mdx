# Ojoche (Breadnut / Maya Nut)

<Callout type="tip" title="The Tree That Fed Maya Civilization">
  The **Ojoche** (_Brosimum alicastrum_), known as the Breadnut or Maya Nut, is
  one of the most important food trees in Mesoamerican history. Its nutritious
  seeds fed millions of Maya people for over 3,000 years, and its presence
  around ancient ruins has helped archaeologists locate lost cities in the
  jungle. Now rediscovered as a **superfood**, the Ojoche offers hope for food
  security in a changing climate—drought-resistant, productive, and highly
  nutritious.

  Emergent tree provides forest architecture - **Year-round resource**: Fruiting
  during lean periods - **Forest regeneration**: Shade-tolerant seedlings
  regenerate forest - **Nutrient cycling**: Deep roots bring nutrients from

### Archaeological Significance

<FeatureBox title="Finding Lost Maya Cities" icon="🏛️">
  Archaeologists have discovered that the presence of Ojoche trees is one of the
  most reliable indicators of ancient Maya settlements. The Maya planted these
  trees extensively around their cities—so reliably that satellite imagery
  showing Ojoche groves has led to the discovery of previously unknown Maya
  sites buried beneath the jungle canopy. The trees persist for centuries after
  cities are abandoned, serving as living markers of lost civilizations.

## Identification Guide

### How to Identify Ojoche

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Key Identification Features" defaultOpen={true}>
    **Definitive Characteristics:**

    1. **Abundant white latex** when bark or leaves cut
    2. **Simple alternate leaves** with entire margins
    3. **Round orange fruits** (2-3 cm) when present
    4. **Large single seed** inside each fruit
    5. **Straight trunk** with gray-brown bark
    6. **Rounded dense crown** in canopy/emergent

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Seasonal Recognition">
    **Flowering (January-March):**
    - Small greenish flower heads
    - Look closely in leaf axils

    **Fruiting (March-June):**
    - Orange fruits obvious
    - Fallen fruits beneath tree
    - Active wildlife feeding

    **Year-Round:**
    - Latex test (cut small branch)

<Callout type="tip" title="Tasting History">
  If you want to taste history, seek out Maya Nut products in Costa Rica's rural
  markets or specialty stores. The roasted seeds make a nutritious,
  caffeine-free coffee substitute with a rich, chocolatey flavor. Maya Nut flour
  can be used in baking. When visiting forested areas during fruiting season
  (March-June), listen for the sound of falling fruits and look beneath large
  forest trees— you might find fresh Ojoche to sample. The sweet orange flesh
  around the seed is delicious raw, while the seed itself should be roasted or
  processed.
