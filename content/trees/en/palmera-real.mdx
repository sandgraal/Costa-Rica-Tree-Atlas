## Physical Description

### Overall Form

The Royal Palm is a tall, single-trunked palm with an unmistakable silhouette. Its smooth, cement-gray trunk is often slightly swollen in the middle (although this varies). The bright green crownshaft—a smooth cylinder of tightly wrapped leaf bases—sits atop the trunk, crowned by 15-20 graceful pinnate fronds that arch elegantly outward.

## Cultural Significance

### National Symbol of Cuba

<Callout type="info" title="Patriotic Palm">
  The Royal Palm is the national tree of Cuba, appearing on the country's coat
  of arms since 1906. It represents the independence and strength of the Cuban
  people. The tree's tall, straight trunk reaching toward the sky is seen as a
  symbol of freedom and aspiration. Cubans call it simply "La Palma Real."

## Distribution in Costa Rica

<Callout type="info" title="Introduced Icon">
  While not native to Costa Rica, the Royal Palm has been widely planted
  throughout the country since colonial times. It graces the capital city's
  parks and boulevards, adorns hotels and estates, and has naturalized in some
  areas. Costa Ricans may encounter native Roystonea species in neighboring
  regions, but R. regia is the most commonly planted.

## Interesting Facts

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="🌪️ Hurricane Survivor">

Despite their tall, slender appearance, Royal Palms are remarkably hurricane
resistant. Their flexible trunks and streamlined crowns allow them to bend
with powerful winds rather than break. After Hurricane Andrew devastated
South Florida in 1992, many Royal Palms were among the few trees left
standing—battered but alive.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="👑 The Most Planted Palm">

Royal Palms may be the most widely planted palm in the tropical world. From
the Caribbean to Southeast Asia, from Africa to South America, they line
countless boulevards and adorn prestigious properties. Their perfect
symmetry and regal bearing have made them the universal symbol of tropical
elegance.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="💚 The Green Cylinder">

The bright green crownshaft is unique to Roystonea and related palms. This
living cylinder is actually the tightly wrapped bases of the newest fronds.
As each frond matures and eventually falls, the crownshaft continuously
renews itself from within—a marvel of botanical engineering.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🐖 Pig Palm">

In rural Cuba, Royal Palm fruits have long been important pig feed. The
small fruits are high in oil and nutrients. So important is this
relationship that some have suggested the palm's spread in Cuba was aided
by early human settlers moving both pigs and palm seeds together.
