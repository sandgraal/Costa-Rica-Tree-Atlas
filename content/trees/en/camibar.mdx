## Distribution & Habitat

### Native Range

<DistributionMap countries={["Costa Rica", "Panama"]} />

<Callout type="info" title="Limited Range">
  _Copaifera aromatica_ has a relatively restricted natural range, found only in
  Costa Rica and Panama. This limited distribution, combined with logging
  pressure, contributes to its vulnerable conservation status.
</Callout>

### Distribution in Costa Rica

Camíbar is primarily found in the lowland and premontane wet forests of Costa Rica's Caribbean slope and the Osa Peninsula region. It favors ridges and hilltops within primary forest.

## Ecological Significance

### Rainforest Giant

<Callout type="success" title="Emergent Canopy Species">
  As an emergent tree that towers above the main canopy, Camíbar plays a crucial
  role in forest structure. Its crown provides nesting sites for large birds,
  its flowers feed pollinators, and its fruits nourish forest wildlife. The loss
  of these forest giants creates gaps in the ecological web.
</Callout>

### Wildlife Interactions

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Pollinators

- **Bees**: Primary pollinators of small flowers
- **Small insects**: Various visitors
- **Wind**: May assist in pollen movement

#### Seed Dispersers

- **Birds**: Attracted to orange-red aril
- **Monkeys**: Consume and disperse seeds
- **Gravity**: Seeds fall near parent tree

</Column>
<Column>

#### Ecological Relationships

- **Nitrogen fixation**: As a legume, may fix atmospheric nitrogen
- **Mycorrhizae**: Forms beneficial fungal associations
- **Epiphytes**: Large crowns host orchids, bromeliads
- **Cavity nesters**: Old trees provide nesting habitat

#### Forest Structure

- **Emergent layer**: Provides forest structure
- **Microhabitats**: Crown supports diverse communities
- **Carbon storage**: Massive trunks store significant carbon

## Cultural & Economic Importance

### The Sacred Copaiba Resin

<FeatureBox title="Medicinal Resin Heritage" icon="🏥">
  **Copaiba resin** (oleoresin) has been harvested from Camíbar and related
  species for centuries. Indigenous peoples of Central and South America used it
  as a remedy for wounds, infections, and inflammatory conditions. Today,
  copaiba oil is valued in aromatherapy, natural cosmetics, and alternative
  medicine worldwide. The resin contains sesquiterpenes with documented
  anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.

### How Copaiba Resin is Harvested

<Callout type="info" title="Traditional Tapping Method">
  Copaiba resin is traditionally harvested by drilling a hole into the trunk of
  the tree, allowing the oleoresin to flow out. A single tree can yield several
  liters of resin per tapping session, and the same tree can be tapped
  repeatedly over many years without killing it—provided sustainable practices
  are followed.

## Conservation Status

### Current Assessment

<QuickRef
  title="Conservation Status"
  items={[
    { label: "IUCN Red List", value: "Vulnerable (VU)" },
    { label: "Population Trend", value: "Decreasing" },
    { label: "Main Threats", value: "Logging, habitat loss" },
    { label: "Range", value: "Endemic to Costa Rica & Panama" },
  ]}
/>

### Conservation Concerns

<Callout type="warning" title="A Vulnerable Giant">
  Camíbar faces significant threats from:

- **Selective logging**: Large trees targeted for valuable timber
- **Resin overexploitation**: Unsustainable tapping practices
- **Habitat loss**: Deforestation reduces available habitat
- **Limited range**: Found only in Costa Rica and Panama
- **Slow reproduction**: Long time to reach maturity

The species' restricted range and the value of both its timber and resin make
it particularly vulnerable to overexploitation.

</Callout>

### Conservation Actions

<SimpleList
  items={[
    "Protected within national parks (Corcovado, Tortuguero, La Amistad)",
    "CITES may provide trade monitoring in the future",
    "Sustainable resin harvesting programs being developed",
    "Seed collection for ex-situ conservation",
    "Community awareness programs in forest communities",

## Cultivation & Propagation

### Growing Camíbar

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Propagation Methods

**From Seeds (Primary Method)**

1. Collect fresh seeds when pods split (Aug-Oct)
2. Remove the fleshy aril immediately
3. Plant within 1-2 weeks (seeds lose viability quickly)
4. Sow in nursery beds or containers
5. Light soil coverage
6. Keep moist but not waterlogged
7. Germination in 20-40 days
8. Transplant at 30-50 cm height

**Key Considerations**

- Seeds have short viability—plant fresh
- Seedlings benefit from partial shade initially
- Very slow growth requires patience

</Column>
<Column>

#### Growing Conditions

<SimpleList
  items={[
    "Sun: Full sun as mature tree; partial shade when young",
    "Soil: Rich, well-drained forest soil",
    "Water: Consistent moisture, humid climate",
    "Spacing: 15-20 m for forest restoration",
    "Growth Rate: Very slow, 30-50 cm/year",
    "Time to Maturity: 40-80+ years for large specimens",
  ]}
/>

#### Challenges

- Extremely slow growth limits commercial interest
- Requires humid tropical climate
- Best suited for conservation plantings, not commercial forestry
- Protect young trees from sun scorch

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

<Callout type="tip" title="Conservation Planting">
  Camíbar is best suited for **enrichment planting** in existing secondary
  forests or protected areas where it will be preserved long-term. Its slow
  growth makes it unsuitable for commercial timber plantations, but it is
  invaluable for restoring natural forest ecosystems and preserving this
  important medicinal species.

## Identification Guide

### How to Identify Camíbar

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Key Identification Features" defaultOpen={true}>
    **Definitive Characteristics:**

    1. **Even-pinnate compound leaves** with 6-12 pairs of leaflets
    2. **Translucent oil glands** visible in leaflets held to light
    3. **Large emergent tree** with straight trunk
    4. **Gray-brown fissured bark** on mature trees
    5. **Flat pods** with single seed covered in orange-red aril
    6. **Aromatic resin** exudes from bark wounds

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Similar Species">
    Trees that might be confused with Camíbar:

    <DataTable
      headers={["Species", "Difference from Camíbar"]}
      rows={[
        ["_Copaifera camibar_", "Very similar, may require botanical expertise to distinguish"],
        ["_Hymenaea courbaril_", "Larger leaflets, different pod shape, no oil glands"],
        ["Other Fabaceae", "Leaf arrangement, fruit type, and resin differ"],
      ]}
    />

    The translucent oil glands in the leaflets are diagnostic for _Copaifera_.

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Seasonal Recognition">
    **Dry Season (January-March):** May lose some leaves; resin production continues

    **Flowering (March-May):** Small white flowers in panicles at branch tips

    **Fruiting (August-October):** Flat pods visible; orange-red arils attract birds

    **Wet Season:** Full green canopy, active growth period
