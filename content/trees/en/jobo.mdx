# Jobo (Yellow Mombin / Hog Plum)

<Callout type="success" title="The Original Tropical Fruit">
  The **Jobo** (_Spondias mombin_), also called **Yellow Mombin** or **Hog
  Plum**, is one of the tropics' most beloved fruit trees. Its **tart, aromatic
  yellow plums** have been enjoyed by humans for thousands of years, and its
  remarkable ability to grow from large stem cuttings makes it the backbone of
  living fence systems across Central America. Every part of this tree is
  useful—from its refreshing fruits to its massive branches that take root when
  simply stuck in the ground.

## Physical Description

### General Form

The Jobo is a large deciduous tree with a spreading crown and thick, often crooked trunk. The bark is distinctive—rough, thick, and deeply furrowed. The tree drops its leaves during the dry season, often fruiting while leafless or as new leaves emerge. Its ability to grow from large stem cuttings makes it unique among tropical trees.

## The Living Fence Tradition

### Stakes That Become Trees

<FeatureBox title="The Amazing Living Fence" icon="🪵">
  One of Jobo's most remarkable characteristics is its ability to root from
  large stem cuttings: **The Process**: 1. Cut large branches (5-20 cm diameter,
  2-3 m long) 2. Simply stick cut end into the ground 3. Branch produces roots
  within weeks 4. Develops into a full tree over years 5. Wire can be attached
  for fencing **Benefits**: - No need to buy fence posts - Posts don't rot or
  need replacement - Trees provide shade for cattle - Fruit bonus for farmer and
  livestock - Carbon sequestration - Wildlife corridors This traditional
  technology has been used for centuries!
</FeatureBox>

### Living Fence Management

<DataTable
  headers={["Aspect", "Practice", "Benefits"]}
  rows={[
    ["Planting", "Plant during early rainy season", "Best rooting success"],
    ["Spacing", "2-4 meters between posts", "Allows crown development"],

    ["Wire", "Attach when posts established", "Durable, living infrastructure"],
    ["Fruit", "Harvest fallen or ripe", "Additional income/food"],
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="success" title="Sustainable Agriculture in Action">
  Living fences of Jobo represent traditional knowledge at its finest: -
  **Economic**: Free fencing material forever - **Ecological**: Habitat
  connectivity, carbon storage - **Practical**: Shade improves livestock welfare
  - **Bonus**: Free fruit crop - **Resilient**: Self-repairing, storm-resistant
  Modern agroforestry programs actively promote this ancient practice!

#### Mammal Consumers

- **Peccaries**: Love fallen fruits
- **Deer**: Eat fruits in dry season
- **Monkeys**: Major consumers
- **Bats**: Eat ripe fruit, disperse seeds
- **Agoutis**: Cache and consume
- **Wild Pigs**: Hence "hog plum"!

</Column>
<Column>

#### Bird Interactions

- **Parrots**: Eat unripe and ripe fruits
- **Toucans**: Swallow fruits whole
- **Chachalacas**: Ground foragers

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

### Forest Dynamics

<Callout type="info" title="Ecosystem Services">
  The Jobo provides multiple ecosystem services: - **Food Web**: Critical fruit
  during dry season - **Seed Dispersal**: Animals carry seeds widely -
  **Shade**: Improves microclimate in pastures - **Pollination**: Flowers
  support many insects - **Connectivity**: Living fences link forest fragments
  Removing Jobo trees from the landscape would impact numerous species!

## Cultivation

### Growing from Cuttings

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Selecting and Preparing Stakes">
    **Best Material**: - Branch diameter: 5-20 cm - Length: 2-3 meters - Age:
    Mature wood (not green) - Condition: Healthy, no disease **Preparation**: -
    Cut at an angle (bottom end) - Allow to dry for a few days - Remove leaves -
    Plant within 1-2 weeks
  </AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Planting">
  **Timing**: Early rainy season (May-June in CR) **Method**: - Dig hole 30-50
  cm deep - Insert stake at slight angle - Pack soil firmly around base - Do NOT
  water excessively **Success Rate**: 70-90% when done properly
</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Care and Development">
    **First Year**: - Roots develop within weeks - New shoots appear within
    months - Protect from livestock damage **Ongoing**: - Minimal care once
    established - Pollarding encourages density - First fruit in 3-5 years
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

### Growing from Seed

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Seed Processing">
    **Collection**: - Gather ripe yellow fruits - Remove flesh (soak in water) -
    Clean fibrous pit - Dry in shade **Germination Challenge**: - Seeds have
    hard coat - Germination can take 2-6 months - Scarification helps
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Why Cuttings Are Preferred">
    <DataTable
      headers={["Method", "Advantages", "Disadvantages"]}
      rows={[
        ["Cuttings", "Fast, reliable, same genetics", "Needs mature tree source"],
        ["Seed", "Genetic diversity", "Slow, unpredictable"],
      ]}
    />

    For most purposes, large cuttings are far superior!

## Identification Guide

### How to Identify Jobo

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Key Features" defaultOpen={true}>
    **Year-Round Identifiers:**

    1. **Deeply furrowed bark** (thick, corky)
    2. **Compound leaves with 9-19 leaflets**
    3. **Aromatic crushed leaves**
    4. **Resinous inner bark**
    5. **Often in living fences**

    **Seasonal Identifiers:**
    - Yellow plum-like fruits (dry season)
    - Deciduous (bare in dry season)
    - Cream flower clusters (before leaves)

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Distinguishing from Relatives">
    <DataTable
      headers={["Species", "Key Difference"]}
      rows={[
        ["_S. purpurea_ (Jocote)", "Red/purple fruit, smaller leaves"],
        ["_Anacardium_ (Cashew)", "Different leaf shape, no compound"],
        ["_Mangifera_ (Mango)", "Simple leaves, different fruit"],
      ]}
    />

    Jobo's yellow fruits + deeply furrowed bark = diagnostic

<Callout type="tip" title="Fruit Season">
  Jobo fruits are most abundant at the **transition from dry to wet season**
  (April-June in most areas): - Look for yellow fallen fruits on the ground -
  Trees may still be partly or fully leafless - Local vendors sell them at
  markets - Ask farmers—they often have trees! If you've never tasted Jobo, the
  pucker-inducing tartness is an unforgettable experience!

<Callout type="info" title="The Farmer's Friend">
  The Jobo embodies the genius of traditional tropical agriculture. A tree that
  asks for almost nothing—stick a branch in the ground and you get a fence post,
  a shade tree, a fruit tree, and wildlife habitat all in one. For centuries,
  Central American farmers have known what scientists are only now
  rediscovering: that working with nature, rather than against it, produces more
  resilient, productive, and sustainable landscapes. Every time you see a living
  fence of Jobo trees stretching across a pasture, you're seeing traditional
  ecological knowledge in action—and tasting a piece of it is just a bonus!
