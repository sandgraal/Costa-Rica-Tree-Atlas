# Guapinol (Jatobá)

<Callout type="info" title="The Amber Tree">
  The **Guapinol** (_Hymenaea courbaril_), known as **Jatobá** in Brazil and
  **Stinking Toe** in the Caribbean, is one of the most culturally and
  economically important trees of tropical America. Its **amber-like resin** has
  preserved ancient insects for millions of years, its **rock-hard wood** is
  prized for flooring and furniture, and its **stinky seed pods** contain
  nutritious flour that sustained indigenous peoples for millennia. A tree of
  remarkable gifts—if you can get past the smell!

## Physical Description

### General Form

The Guapinol is a large, semi-deciduous to evergreen tree with a massive trunk and broad spreading crown. It's one of the emergent giants of Neotropical forests, often towering above the surrounding canopy. The bark exudes fragrant amber-colored resin, and the seed pods are unmistakable—both visually and olfactorily!

## The Amber Connection

### Copal and Fossil Amber

<FeatureBox title="From Resin to Amber: A 20-Million-Year Story" icon="💎">
  The Guapinol genus (_Hymenaea_) is the source of some of the world's most
  famous amber deposits: **Living Resin (Copal)**: - Fresh resin is sticky,
  aromatic - Hardens into "copal" over decades/centuries - Used in varnishes,
  incense, traditional medicine **Fossil Amber**: - Extinct _Hymenaea_ species
  created famous ambers - Dominican amber: 15-20 million years old - Mexican
  amber: 22-26 million years old - Often contains trapped insects, spiders,
  plants - Key source for paleontology research Today's Guapinol is the living
  relative of these amber-producing trees, and its resin will eventually become
  amber in millions of years!
</FeatureBox>

<Callout type="info" title="Jurassic Park Connection">
  The famous movie premise of extracting dinosaur DNA from amber mosquitoes is
  science fiction, but amber DOES preserve remarkable ancient specimens. Most
  famous amber comes from extinct relatives of the Guapinol. The amber you buy
  today may have come from trees very similar to those still standing in Costa
  Rican forests!

## Ecological Importance

### Ecosystem Roles

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Seed Dispersal

- **Primary**: Large rodents (agoutis, pacas)
- **Secondary**: Tapirs, peccaries
- **Mechanism**: Animals cache and forget seeds
- **Pattern**: Long-distance dispersal
- **Germination**: Requires scarification

#### Food Web Role

- **Flowers**: Bats, moths, bees
- **Fruit Pulp**: Rodents, monkeys, tapirs
- **Seeds**: Specialized rodent consumers
- **Foliage**: Some specialized insects
- **Dead Wood**: Decomposer communities

</Column>
<Column>

#### Forest Dynamics

- **Nitrogen Fixation**: Yes (legume family)
- **Canopy Position**: Emergent/upper canopy
- **Shade**: Creates forest microhabitats
- **Persistence**: Long-lived, stable populations
- **Regeneration**: Gap dynamics

#### Wildlife Habitat

- **Cavities**: Large branches, nest sites
- **Epiphytes**: Support orchids, bromeliads
- **Roots**: Shelter for ground fauna
- **Crown**: Bird territories

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

<Callout type="success" title="A Keystone Species">
  The Guapinol is considered a keystone species in many forests because: - Its
  massive fruits feed animals when other food is scarce - Large rodents depend
  on it (and vice versa for seed dispersal) - Its emergent canopy creates forest
  structure - Nitrogen fixation enriches forest soils - Long lifespan provides
  habitat stability Forests with healthy Guapinol populations tend to have
  healthy wildlife populations overall.

<Callout type="warning" title="Sustainability Concerns">
  While Guapinol is listed as Least Concern, large specimens are increasingly
  rare due to: - High timber value drives selective logging - Slow growth makes
  recovery difficult - Large trees needed for reproduction - Habitat loss
  reduces populations Sustainable forestry and plantation cultivation are
  important for maintaining this valuable species.

## Cultivation and Propagation

### Growing Guapinol

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Seed Collection and Preparation">
    **Collection**: - Collect ripe pods from ground (March-June typically) -

<Callout type="info" title="The Tree of Time">
  The Guapinol connects us to deep time like few other trees. Its ancient
  relatives created the amber that now preserves prehistoric life in museum
  collections worldwide. Today's living Guapinol still produces the same
  remarkable resin, still feeds the same forest animals, still provides the same
  hard wood and stinky (but nutritious!) fruit. To stand beneath a Guapinol is
  to stand beneath a tree whose lineage reaches back tens of millions of years—a
  living link to forests that existed before humans walked the Earth.
