# Tempisque

<Callout type="success" title="The Ironwood of the Dry Forest">
  **Tempisque** (_Sideroxylon capiri_), one of Costa Rica's most valuable native
  hardwoods, is so central to the Guanacaste landscape that it gave its name to
  the region's great river—the **Río Tempisque**. This magnificent dry forest
  tree produces wood so dense it sinks in water, earning it comparisons to
  ironwood. Deciduous during the harsh dry season, Tempisque reveals its massive
  branching architecture against the blue sky, then clothes itself in fresh
  green leaves with the first rains. Its sweet fruits attract diverse wildlife,
  making it a keystone species of the tropical dry forest ecosystem.

## Physical Description

### Overall Form

Tempisque is a large deciduous tree with a thick, often fluted trunk and broad spreading crown. In the dry season, it stands completely leafless, its dramatic silhouette revealing massive horizontal branches. With the rains, it rapidly produces fresh foliage and becomes a dense shade tree.

## The Río Tempisque Connection

<Callout type="info" title="A Tree That Named a River">
  The Río Tempisque, Costa Rica's second-longest river, takes its name from this
  tree: **The Tempisque Basin**: - Drains most of Guanacaste Province - 144 km
  long, flows into Gulf of Nicoya - Historically lined with Tempisque trees -
  Cultural and ecological heart of dry forest region **Why the Name**: -
  Tempisque trees were abundant along riverbanks - Provided shade for indigenous
  communities - Marked the landscape's identity - Name preserved even as trees
  declined **Modern Significance**: - River supports wetlands of international
  importance - Palo Verde National Park at delta - Agricultural irrigation
  lifeline - Conservation focus area The tree's decline has been so severe that
  many who know the river have never seen the tree that gave it its name.

## Ecological Importance

### Wildlife Value

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Fruit Consumers

- **Monkeys**: Spider and howler monkeys
- **Birds**: Trogons, toucans, many others
- **Bats**: Fruit bats disperse seeds
- **Peccaries**: Eat fallen fruit
- **Coatis**: Climb for fruit

</Column>
<Column>

#### Ecosystem Role

- **Food timing**: Fruits in dry season (critical)
- **Canopy structure**: Major dry forest framework
- **Shade**: Important for cattle, wildlife
- **Soil**: Deep roots access groundwater
- **Biodiversity**: Supports dry forest fauna

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

<FeatureBox title="Dry Season Food Source" icon="🍇">
  Tempisque fruits ripen during the harshest dry season months: **Timing
  Importance**: - Fruits: January-April - When other food scarce - Sustains
  wildlife through drought - Critical for frugivore survival **Consumer List**:
  - At least 20+ bird species recorded - Multiple mammal species - Important
  bat-dispersed seeds **Keystone Status**: - Loss of Tempisque = food gap -
  Cascading effects on wildlife - Restoration priority species The tree's dry
  season fruiting makes it a keystone species for the tropical dry forest food
  web.
</FeatureBox>

## Conservation Status

<Callout type="warning" title="Near Threatened">
  Tempisque populations have declined dramatically: **Historical Decline**: -
  Once abundant throughout dry forest - Intensively logged for valuable timber -
  Agricultural conversion of habitat - Now relatively rare in the wild **Current
  Threats**: - Continued logging pressure - Habitat loss to ranching - Fire
  damage - Slow reproduction **Conservation Efforts**: - Protected in national
  parks and reserves - Reforestation programs include species - CITES Appendix
  II (trade regulated) - Research on ecology and propagation **Restoration
  Challenges**: - Slow growth (decades to maturity) - Specific habitat
  requirements - Limited natural regeneration - Seed predation by wildlife

    **Ideal Conditions**: - Full sun exposure - Well-drained soil - Dry forest
    climate (seasonal drought) - Low to mid elevation - Protection from fire
    (young trees) **Not Suitable**: - Wet forest areas (too humid) - Poorly
    drained soils - Constant shade - High elevations
  </AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Propagation">
  **From Seed**: - Collect ripe fruits (purple-black) - Remove pulp carefully -
  Plant fresh (viability decreases) - Germination in 3-8 weeks - Shade seedlings
  initially **Challenges**: - Heavy seed predation - Slow initial growth -
  Seedlings need protection - Patience required (slow-growing)
</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Restoration Planting">
    **Why Plant Tempisque**: - Native dry forest restoration - Carbon
    sequestration (dense wood) - Wildlife food source - Cultural heritage
    **Considerations**: - Very slow growth (decades to timber size) - Long-term
    commitment - Protection from grazing animals - Fire prevention critical

  dramatic branching visible | | Early wet (May) | Fresh bright green leaves
  emerging | | Wet (Jun-Nov) | Full dense canopy, dark green | | Fruiting
  (Jan-Apr) | Purple-black fruits visible | The complete leaf drop in dry season
  is distinctive among large dry forest trees.
</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Similar Species">
    | Feature | Tempisque | Níspero | |---------|-----------|---------| | Leaves
    | Deciduous | Evergreen | | Bark | Deeply furrowed | Rough but less furrowed
    | | Fruit | Small, 2-3 cm | Large, 5-10 cm | | Habitat | Dry forest | Wet

    ["Private ranches, Guanacaste", "Pasture trees", "Often large old trees"],
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="tip" title="Finding Tempisque">
  Tempisque is uncommon but distinctive when you find it: **Where to Look**: -
  Protected dry forest reserves - Old pastures with remnant trees - Along rivers
  in Guanacaste - Gallery forest edges **Best Time**: - Dry season: Dramatic
  leafless form visible - December-January: Flowering - January-April: Fruiting
  **Identification Tips**: - Look for massive, spreading architecture - Dark,
  deeply furrowed bark - Complete leaf loss in dry season - Check for milky sap
  if cut Large old trees in pastures often survived because ranchers valued
  their shade—seek these "heritage trees."

<Callout type="success" title="The Iron Bones of Guanacaste">
  Stand beside the Río Tempisque in the dry season's golden light, and imagine
  this landscape as it once was: the riverbanks lined with great Tempisque
  trees, their leafless branches etched against the sky like iron sculptures,
  their massive trunks providing shade and shelter for the communities that
  gathered beneath them. This tree gave its name to the river, and through the
  river, became woven into the identity of an entire region. Its wood, dense
  enough to sink in water, built the foundations of pre-Columbian villages and
  colonial churches alike—construction that has outlasted generations. Today,
  Tempisque trees are rare, scattered survivors in a landscape transformed by
  cattle ranches and farms. But each one that remains is a living monument to
  the great dry forests that once covered this land. When they fruit in the
  desperate months of the dry season, they feed the creatures that depend on
  them, maintaining ecological connections that span millennia. To plant a
  Tempisque is to plant for centuries—to invest in a future that your
  great-grandchildren might see mature. It is an act of faith in the endurance
  of Guanacaste's wild heritage.
