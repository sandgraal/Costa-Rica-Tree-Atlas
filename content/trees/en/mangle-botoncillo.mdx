# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "low"
toxicParts:
  - "bark"
skinContactRisk: "none"
allergenRisk: "low"
structuralRisks: []
childSafe: true
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "Buttonwood bark contains moderate concentrations of tannins used historically for leather tanning. Tannins are not highly toxic but can cause mild stomach upset if bark is consumed in large quantities. Leaves and fruits are not toxic. Not a concern for casual contact with the tree."
skinContactDetails: "Safe for all skin contact. No irritation from leaves, bark, flowers, or sap. The salt glands on leaf bases are harmless. No reports of dermatitis or skin sensitivity. Safe to prune and handle."
allergenDetails: "Low allergen risk. Flowers are small and inconspicuous, producing minimal allergenic pollen. Some sensitive individuals may experience very mild respiratory irritation during heavy flowering. No significant allergic reactions documented."
structuralRiskDetails: "No significant structural risks. Unlike other mangroves, buttonwood typically grows conventional trunk and branches without extensive prop roots or pneumatophores in most locations. Branches are relatively strong. Safe to plant near structures."
safetyNotes: "Buttonwood is a very safe species suitable for landscaping, coastal restoration, and wildlife habitat. Often used as ornamental tree in warm climates. Both green and silver varieties are safe. No special handling precautions needed. Good choice for coastal plantings and windbreaks."
wildlifeRisks: "Safe for all wildlife. Provides habitat for coastal birds, insects, and small mammals. Seeds eaten by various bird species. Not toxic to pets, livestock, or marine life. Excellent wildlife-friendly landscape tree."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "moderate"
growthRateDetails: "2-4 ft/year in good conditions; faster than most mangroves; responds well to cultivation"
matureSize: "15-20 m tall (50-65 ft), often multi-trunked with dense rounded crown; can be maintained smaller as hedge"
hardiness: "Tropical and subtropical coastal zones 0-10m elevation; salt-tolerant but adaptable to non-saline conditions; frost-sensitive"
soilRequirements: "Very adaptable; grows in saline, brackish, or freshwater conditions; tolerates sandy, clay, or limestone soils; good drainage preferred"
waterNeeds: "moderate"
waterDetails: "Moderate water needs - more adaptable than other mangroves. Can grow in periodically dry conditions once established. Tolerates both brackish coastal zones and inland sites with freshwater. Does not require tidal inundation. Drought-tolerant once mature."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plant 3-5 m apart for specimen trees; 1-2 m for hedges; 5-8 m for coastal windbreaks"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
  - "cuttings"
propagationDifficulty: "easy"
plantingSeason: "Plant during rainy season (May-November) for best establishment; can plant year-round in irrigated sites"
maintenanceNeeds: "LOW TO MODERATE MAINTENANCE. Buttonwood is more manageable than true mangroves. Year 1-2: Water regularly during dry season, protect from extreme weather. Years 3+: Drought-tolerant, minimal care needed. Pruning: Can be pruned to maintain size/shape for landscaping. Makes excellent hedge with regular trimming. Fertilization: Not typically needed - adapted to poor soils. Can benefit from occasional organic fertilizer in poor soils. Pests: Generally pest-free. Occasional scale insects or caterpillars - easily managed. Salt tolerance: Excellent for coastal sites exposed to salt spray. Also grows well inland without salt."
commonProblems:
  - "Frost damage in cold snaps (below 0°C) - protect young trees"
  - "Occasional scale insects on leaves - treat with horticultural oil"
  - "Can self-seed prolifically in moist conditions - easy to control"
  - "Silver variety (sericeus) may revert to green form - prune out green growth"
  - "Young plants may need staking in windy sites"
  - "Overwatering can cause root rot - ensure good drainage"

# Buttonwood Mangrove (Mangle Botoncillo)

<Callout type="success" title="The Versatile Coastal Tree">
  **Buttonwood** (_Conocarpus erectus_) is the most adaptable of mangrove
  associates, forming the outermost edge of mangrove ecosystems while also
  thriving inland. Neither a true mangrove nor an ordinary tree, it bridges
  coastal and terrestrial worlds with remarkable salt tolerance, ornamental
  beauty, and ecological value.

## Physical Description

### General Form

Buttonwood is typically a dense, multi-trunked shrub or small tree with a compact rounded crown. It can be maintained as a large shrub (2-4 m) through pruning, or allowed to grow into a substantial tree (15-20 m). Unlike true mangroves (Rhizophora, Avicennia), it lacks specialized aerial roots in most situations, growing instead with conventional branching.

## Ecological Importance

### The Transition Zone Facilitator

<Callout type="success" title="Ecological Role as Facultative Halophyte">
  Buttonwood occupies a unique ecological niche: **Position**: - Outermost edge
  of mangrove systems - Transition between marine and terrestrial - Can grow in
  both saline and freshwater environments **Function**: - Stabilizes the
  mangrove-upland boundary - Provides habitat for both coastal and terrestrial
  species - Acts as windbreak protecting inland areas - Accumulates organic
  matter and carbon **Adaptability**: - Not dependent on tidal flooding like
  true mangroves - Can colonize disturbed upland sites - Extends mangrove
  ecosystem benefits landward
</Callout>

### Wildlife Relationships

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Birds

- **Herons**: Nest in canopy
- **Warblers**: Forage in foliage
- **Mangrove Cuckoo**: Breeding habitat
- **Seedeaters**: Consume seeds
- **Various species**: Shelter and perching

</Column>
<Column>

#### Other Wildlife

- **Crabs**: Forage in leaf litter
- **Lizards**: Bask on branches and trunk
- **Insects**: Pollinators and herbivores
- **Small mammals**: Shelter in dense thickets
- **Epiphytes**: Orchids and bromeliads on branches

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

---

## Adaptations and Ecology

### Salt Management Strategy

<FeatureBox title="Flexible Salt Tolerance" icon="💧">
  Buttonwood's adaptability comes from flexible salt management: **Facultative
  Halophyte**: - Can tolerate salt but doesn't require it - Thrives in both
  saline and freshwater conditions - Outperforms in low-salt environments
  **Mechanism**: - Salt glands at leaf base excrete excess salt - Less efficient
  than true mangrove adaptations - Sufficient for landward zones where salinity
  is moderate **Result**: - Broader habitat range than obligate mangroves - Can
  colonize inland sites - Used in landscaping far from coast
</FeatureBox>

### Competition and Zonation

<DataTable
  headers={["Zone", "Dominant Species", "Buttonwood Role"]}
  rows={[
    ["Seaward", "Red Mangrove (Rhizophora)", "ABSENT - too saline"],

<Callout type="success" title="The Bridge Between Worlds">
  Buttonwood may be the most underappreciated tree in coastal Costa Rica. While
  its mangrove relatives get the attention for their dramatic adaptations,
  buttonwood quietly does the essential work of connecting sea and land. It
  stabilizes the crucial transition zone, provides habitat for species from both
  realms, and demonstrates that sometimes the most valuable adaptation is
  flexibility. Whether you encounter it as a silvery hedge in a San José garden
  or a windswept sentinel at the mangrove's edge, remember: this versatile tree
  is helping maintain the boundary where two worlds meet. Every buttonwood is a
  bridge-builder, working to keep coastal ecosystems connected and resilient.
