# Caña Fístula (Golden Shower Tree)

<Callout type="success" title="Liquid Gold in the Dry Season">
  The **Caña Fístula** (_Cassia fistula_), known as the **Golden Shower Tree**,
  creates one of nature's most stunning visual spectacles. During the dry
  season, when this deciduous tree has dropped its leaves, it erupts in
  **cascading clusters of brilliant yellow flowers** that drip from every branch
  like liquid sunshine. Entire trees become golden waterfalls, visible from
  great distances. Originally from South Asia, it has become one of the most
  beloved ornamental trees throughout the tropics.

## Ecological Role

### Despite Being Introduced...

<Callout type="success" title="A Welcome Guest">
  Although the Caña Fístula is not native to the Americas, it has integrated
  well into local ecosystems without becoming invasive: **Benefits**: -
  **Pollinators**: Major nectar source for bees - **Birds**: Attract seed-eating
  species - **Butterflies**: Important nectar plant - **Urban Wildlife**:
  Provides food in cities - **Honey**: Produces distinctive honey Unlike some
  introduced species, Caña Fístula doesn't spread aggressively and requires
  human planting to reproduce locally.
</Callout>

### Wildlife Interactions

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Flower Visitors

- **Carpenter Bees**: Primary pollinators
- **Honeybees**: Important nectar collectors
- **Butterflies**: Various species
- **Hummingbirds**: Occasional visitors

</Column>
<Column>

#### Pod/Seed Consumers

- **Parakeets**: Eat seeds from pods
- **Squirrels**: Gnaw on pods
- **Rodents**: Consume fallen seeds
- **Cattle**: Eat fallen pods (mild laxative!)

## Landscaping and Ornamental Use

### The Perfect Flowering Tree

<FeatureBox title="Why Plant Caña Fístula?" icon="🌳">
  The Golden Shower Tree is ideal for tropical landscaping: **Advantages**: - ✅
  Stunning annual flower display - ✅ Moderate size (fits most properties) - ✅
  Drought tolerant once established - ✅ Fast-growing - ✅ Provides light shade
  - ✅ Attracts pollinators - ✅ Low maintenance **Considerations**: - ⚠️ Pods
  can be messy when falling - ⚠️ Needs full sun for best flowering - ⚠️
  Deciduous (bare in dry season before bloom) - ⚠️ Frost sensitive
</FeatureBox>

### Planting Guidelines

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Site Selection">
    **Location Requirements**: - Full sun (essential for flowering) - Space for
    mature crown spread (10-15 m) - Away from buildings (root spread) - Good
    drainage (doesn't like wet feet) **Best Settings**: - Parks and plazas -
    Large gardens - Street plantings - Golf courses - Resort landscapes
  </AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Planting and Care">
  **Planting**: - Best planted at start of rainy season - Dig hole twice pot
  width - Don't plant too deep - Water well initially **Maintenance**: - Water
  weekly first 2 years - Reduce once established - Light pruning if needed -
  Remove pods for tidiness (optional)
</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Flowering Optimization">
    **To Maximize Flowers**: - Full sun is essential - Drought stress can
    trigger heavier flowering - Don't over-fertilize (reduces flowers) - Allow
    natural leaf drop **Timing**: - Flowers appear on bare branches - Usually
    late dry season - Duration: 2-4 weeks per tree
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

## Propagation

### Growing from Seed

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Seed Collection">
    **When to Collect**: - Pods mature 6-12 months after flowering - Dark
    brown/black pods are ready - Pods should rattle when shaken **Processing**:
    - Break open woody pods - Separate seeds from sticky pulp - Clean and dry
    seeds - Store in cool, dry place
  </AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Germination">
  **Treatment Required**: - Seeds have hard coat - Scarify: Nick with file or
  sandpaper - OR: Soak in hot water overnight - OR: Sulfuric acid treatment
  (professional) **Planting**: - Plant 2 cm deep - Keep moist but not wet -
  Germination: 1-4 weeks - Transplant when 15-20 cm tall
</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Growth Timeline">
    | Age | Size | Notes | |-----|------|-------| | 1 year | 0.5-1 m | Seedling
    | | 3 years | 2-4 m | Young tree | | 5 years | 4-6 m | May start flowering |
    | 10 years | 8-12 m | Full flowering | | 15+ years | 12-15 m | Mature
