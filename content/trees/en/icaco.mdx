# Icaco (Cocoplum)

<Callout type="success" title="The Beach Fruit">
  The **Icaco** (_Chrysobalanus icaco_), commonly known as Cocoplum or Paradise
  Plum, is a remarkable coastal plant that thrives in beach environments where
  few other fruit trees dare to grow. This tough shrub or small tree produces
  sweet, plum-like fruits in colors ranging from creamy white to deep
  purple-black. Found along both the Caribbean and Pacific coasts of Costa Rica,
  the Icaco has sustained coastal communities for millennia and remains a
  treasured beach treat today.

## Cultivation

### Growing Icaco

<FeatureBox title="Cultivation Guide" icon="🌱">
  **Ideal Conditions**:
  - Full sun to partial shade
  - Sandy, well-drained soil (tolerates poor soil)
  - Salt spray tolerance excellent
  - Heat tolerant; frost sensitive

**Propagation**:

- **Seed**: Fresh seed germinates in 1-3 months
- **Cuttings**: Semi-hardwood cuttings root well
- **Layering**: Natural layers can be separated

**Care**:

- Minimal water once established
- No fertilizer needed in coastal settings
- Prune to shape as desired
- First fruit: 3-5 years from seed

</FeatureBox>

### Inland Cultivation

While naturally coastal, Icaco can be grown inland:

<Callout type="tip" title="Growing Away from Coast">
  - Needs excellent drainage - Full sun essential - May need occasional watering
  inland - Grows taller without coastal winds - Produces well in tropical
  lowlands
</Callout>

## Conservation Status

<Callout type="info" title="Conservation Notes">
  **IUCN Status**: Least Concern (LC)

The Icaco is widespread and abundant throughout its range. However, coastal development threatens some populations:

**Threats**:

- Beach resort development
- Coastal erosion (natural)
- Clearing for agriculture
- Climate change effects on coastlines

**Positive Factors**:

- Wide distribution across two continents
- Valued for landscaping
- Increasing use in coastal restoration
- Climate-resilient (heat/drought tolerant)

</Callout>

## Cultural Significance

<Callout type="leaf" title="Coastal Heritage">
  Throughout the Caribbean and coastal Latin America, the Icaco represents beach
  life and coastal culture. In Cuba, _dulce de icaco_ (icaco preserve) is a
  beloved traditional sweet. In coastal Colombia and Venezuela, the fruit
  appears in local markets during season. For Costa Rica's Afro-Caribbean
  coastal communities, the Icaco connects to broader Caribbean food traditions
  and beach-gathering practices.

_The Icaco (Chrysobalanus icaco) is a testament to nature's adaptability—a fruit tree that thrives where others fail. Its ability to produce sweet fruits in harsh coastal conditions has made it invaluable to beach communities for thousands of years. Whether eaten fresh off the bush during a beach walk or preserved into traditional sweets, the Icaco offers a taste of Costa Rica's coastal heritage._
