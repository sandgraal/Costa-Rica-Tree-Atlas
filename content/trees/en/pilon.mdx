# Pilón

**Pilón** (_Hyeronima alchorneoides_) is not a showpiece wood. It is a trust wood—selected when longevity, strength, and reliability matter. For Costa Rica, it remains one of the most important and quietly dependable native hardwoods.

## Taxonomy & Classification

- **Kingdom**: Plantae
- **Clade**: Angiosperms
- **Clade**: Eudicots
- **Order**: Malpighiales
- **Family**: Phyllanthaceae
- **Genus**: Hyeronima
- **Species**: Hyeronima alchorneoides

### Common Names

- **Costa Rica**: Pilón
- **Panama**: Pilón
- **Nicaragua**: Pilón
- **Colombia**: Pilón rojo (regional)
- **English (informal)**: Pilón hardwood

## Geographic Distribution

Pilón is native to Central America and northern South America, with a strong presence in:

- Costa Rica
- Panama
- Nicaragua
- Colombia
- Parts of Venezuela and Ecuador

In Costa Rica, it is commonly found in lowland and premontane zones, particularly in humid and very humid forests.

## Habitat & Ecology

- **Elevation range**: Sea level to ~1,000 m
- **Climate**: Humid tropical
- **Soils**: Well-drained, fertile soils; tolerant of varied conditions
- **Forest role**: Canopy to sub-canopy species

Pilón is a medium- to large-sized forest tree, contributing to forest structure and long-term biomass. It is not a pioneer species; it thrives in established forest systems.

## Botanical Description

### Tree Form

- **Height**: 25–40 m
- **Trunk**: Straight, cylindrical, often branch-free for several meters
- **Crown**: Rounded to irregular
- **Buttressing**: Minimal to moderate in older specimens

### Bark

- **Color**: Gray to dark brown
- **Texture**: Rough, fissured with age

### Leaves

- **Type**: Simple, alternate
- **Shape**: Elliptic to oblong
- **Surface**: Smooth, leathery
- **Color**: Medium to dark green

### Flowers

- Small, inconspicuous
- Typically greenish or pale
- Pollination primarily by insects

### Fruit

- Small capsules
- Dispersed naturally within forest systems

## Wood Anatomy & Appearance

### Color

- **Freshly cut**: Pale pink, salmon, or light reddish
- **Aged/oxidized**: Warm reddish-brown to deep brown

### Grain

Straight to slightly interlocked

### Texture

Medium to fine, even and uniform

### Figure

Subtle; understated rather than decorative. Pilón is valued for its quiet visual consistency rather than dramatic figure.

## Physical & Mechanical Properties

| Property                  | Characteristic                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Density**               | Medium to high                        |
| **Hardness**              | Comparable to teak or slightly harder |
| **Weight**                | Moderate-heavy                        |
| **Strength**              | High                                  |
| **Dimensional stability** | Good for a tropical hardwood          |

### Durability & Resistance

- **Natural durability**: High
- **Resistance to insects**: Good
- **Resistance to fungal decay**: Good
- **Outdoor performance**: Excellent when properly sealed

Pilón's natural resistance has historically made it a preferred choice for structural and long-term applications.

### Behavior in Humidity

Pilón responds to humidity like all solid wood, but:

- Movement is moderate and predictable
- Performs well under air-drying conditions
- Less prone to catastrophic warping than many tropical species

**Common errors** typically arise from:

- Rapid drying (sun exposure)
- Rigid fixing of wide boards
- Premature sealing

## Traditional & Modern Uses

### Traditional Uses

- Structural beams
- Flooring
- Door and window frames
- Heavy rural furniture

### Modern Uses

- Furniture and tabletops
- Interior architectural elements
- Stairs and handrails
- Outdoor furniture (covered environments)

Pilón is often selected when reliability matters more than visual extravagance.

## Workability

### Machining

- Machines cleanly with sharp tools
- Can dull blades faster than softwoods
- Interlocked grain may require reduced feed rates

### Hand Tools

- Responds well to planes and chisels
- Tear-out possible if rushed

### Fasteners & Glue

- Excellent screw-holding capacity
- Bonds well with standard wood adhesives

## Drying Characteristics

**Preferred method**: Air drying

**Recommended practice**:

- Shade
- Good airflow
- Stickering
- End sealing

### Drying Time (Costa Rica)

| Application               | Time Required      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Structural use            | Several months     |
| Furniture-grade stability | 3–6 months minimum |
| Full equilibrium          | Up to 12 months    |

## Finishing Characteristics

Pilón accepts finishes very well when properly prepared.

### Best Finishes

- Hardwax oils
- Tung oil
- Oil + wax systems

### Acceptable

- Satin polyurethane (with care)

### Not Recommended

- Thick film-forming finishes
- Heavy epoxy coatings (unless functionally required)

The wood darkens attractively over time and benefits from breathable finishes.

## Maintenance & Aging

- Low maintenance
- Periodic re-oiling if applicable
- Repairs are straightforward

Pilón develops a rich patina with age rather than deteriorating visually.

## Sustainability & Availability

Historically overharvested, Pilón is currently available through:

- Plantations
- Regulated forestry
- Reclaimed lumber

In Costa Rica, pilón is now considered a managed resource, and responsible sourcing is essential.

## Strengths

- High durability
- Reliable structural performance
- Good stability in tropical climates
- Long service life
- Honest, understated aesthetics

## Limitations

- Not lightweight
- Not visually dramatic
- Requires respect for wood movement
- Punishes rushed processing

## Cultural & Practical Significance

Pilón represents a traditional Costa Rican approach to wood:

- Build once
- Build strong
- Expect longevity

It is a species chosen by experience rather than fashion.
