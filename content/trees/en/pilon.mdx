## Wood Anatomy & Appearance

### Color Transformation

<ColorSwatch
  colors={[
    { name: "Fresh Cut", hex: "#E8B4A0", description: "Pale pink to salmon" },
    { name: "Light Oxidation", hex: "#C4826A", description: "Light reddish" },

    { name: "Mature Patina", hex: "#5D3328", description: "Deep brown" },
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="tip" title="Natural Beauty">
  Pilón's color transformation over time is one of its subtle charms. The wood
  darkens from pale pink when freshly cut to a rich, warm brown—developing
  character rather than deteriorating.
</Callout>

### Grain & Texture

| Characteristic | Description                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Grain**      | Straight to slightly interlocked           |
| **Texture**    | Medium to fine, even and uniform           |
| **Figure**     | Subtle; understated rather than decorative |

> Pilón is valued for its **quiet visual consistency** rather than dramatic figure. This makes it ideal for applications where reliability and uniformity matter more than visual drama.

## Behavior in Humidity

<Callout type="warning" title="Critical for Costa Rica">
  Understanding wood movement is essential in Costa Rica's tropical climate.
  Pilón responds to humidity like all solid wood, but its movement is **moderate
  and predictable**.
</Callout>

### Performance Characteristics

- ✅ Movement is moderate and predictable
- ✅ Performs well under air-drying conditions
- ✅ Less prone to catastrophic warping than many tropical species

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

| ❌ Error                    | 💡 Solution                          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Rapid drying (sun exposure) | Dry in shade with good airflow       |
| Rigid fixing of wide boards | Allow for wood movement              |
| Premature sealing           | Ensure proper moisture content first |
| Skipping acclimatization    | Let wood adjust to site conditions   |

## Workability

### Machining

| Operation | Performance | Notes                       |
| --------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| Sawing    | Good        | Use sharp blades            |
| Planing   | Good        | Watch for interlocked grain |
| Routing   | Good        | Reduced feed rates help     |
| Sanding   | Excellent   | Finishes smoothly           |

<Callout type="warning" title="Tool Wear">
  Pilón can dull blades faster than softwoods due to its density. Keep your
  tools sharp and expect more frequent sharpening cycles.
</Callout>

### Hand Tools & Fasteners

- ✅ Responds well to planes and chisels
- ✅ Excellent screw-holding capacity
- ✅ Bonds well with standard wood adhesives
- ⚠️ Tear-out possible if rushed—take your time

### Best Practices

| Do ✅                       | Don't ❌                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Dry in shade                | Expose to direct sun     |
| Use stickers between boards | Stack boards directly    |
| Seal end grain              | Leave ends exposed       |
| Ensure good airflow         | Restrict air circulation |
| Be patient                  | Rush the process         |

## Finishing Characteristics

Pilón accepts finishes very well when properly prepared.

### Finish Recommendations

| Category         | Options                                   | Notes                        |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Best** 🌟      | Hardwax oils, Tung oil, Oil + wax systems | Allows wood to breathe       |
| **Acceptable** ✓ | Satin polyurethane                        | Apply with care              |
| **Avoid** ⚠️     | Thick film finishes, Heavy epoxy          | Unless functionally required |

<Callout type="tip" title="Finishing Secret">
  The wood **darkens attractively over time** and benefits from breathable
  finishes that allow this natural patina to develop. Avoid thick film finishes
  that lock the wood in its current color.
</Callout>

## Sustainability & Availability

<Callout type="warning" title="Conservation Note">
  Pilón was historically overharvested due to its excellent properties. Today,
  responsible sourcing is essential.
</Callout>

### Current Sources

| Source                 | Status        | Notes                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Plantations**        | ✅ Available  | Best sustainable option |
| **Regulated Forestry** | ✅ Available  | With proper permits     |
| **Reclaimed Lumber**   | ✅ Available  | Excellent choice        |
| **Wild Harvest**       | ⚠️ Restricted | Requires permits        |

In Costa Rica, Pilón is now considered a **managed resource**. Always verify the source and ensure wood comes from legal, sustainable operations.

---

## Summary

### Strengths 💪

- ✅ High natural durability
- ✅ Reliable structural performance
- ✅ Good stability in tropical climates
- ✅ Long service life (generations)
- ✅ Honest, understated aesthetics
- ✅ Develops beautiful patina

### Limitations ⚠️

- ⚠️ Not lightweight—plan for weight
- ⚠️ Not visually dramatic—subtle beauty
- ⚠️ Requires respect for wood movement
- ⚠️ Punishes rushed processing
- ⚠️ Requires sustainable sourcing
