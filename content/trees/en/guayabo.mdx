description: "The Guayabo, or Guava Tree, is one of the most widespread and beloved fruit trees in the American tropics. Though its origins are debated between Mexico and South America, this small tree has spread throughout tropical regions worldwide. Its fragrant fruit—with distinctive pink or white flesh and abundant seeds—is eaten fresh, made into juices, pastes, and jellies, and provides essential nutrition to both humans and wildlife. The Guayabo exemplifies how a native tropical species can become a global fruit."

# Guayabo (Guava)

<Callout type="success" title="The Tropical Fruit Tree Supreme">
  **Guayabo** (_Psidium guajava_), the common guava, is arguably the most
  successful native American tropical fruit tree in the world. From its origins
  somewhere in the tropical Americas—possibly Mexico, possibly South
  America—guava has spread to every warm region on Earth. Its small, fragrant
  fruits with their distinctive aroma, seedy flesh, and unmistakable flavor have
  made guava beloved across cultures. In Costa Rica, guava grows wild in
  pastures and forest edges, is cultivated in home gardens, and sustains
  countless birds and mammals. This is a tree that nourishes everyone—from the
  toucans in the canopy to the children climbing its branches.

<Callout type="success" title="The Tree in Every Garden">
  There is hardly a village in Costa Rica without its guava trees— the spreading
  crowns with their distinctive mottled bark, the fragrant fruit ripening in the
  sun, the children who know exactly which tree has the sweetest guavas and
  exactly when they'll be ready. This is a tree that has fed humanity for
  thousands of years, that spread from its origins in the Americas to every warm
  corner of the globe, carrying its sweet bounty and its medicine with it. In
  Costa Rica, whether native or anciently naturalized, the guayabo has become
  inseparable from the landscape and the culture. The juice is served cold on
  hot afternoons. The jellies appear on breakfast tables. The fallen fruit feeds
  the agoutis and the toucans, completing the cycle. When you smell that
  unmistakable aroma drifting through a country road, you're smelling something
  very old and very essential—a tree that asks only for sun and water and gives
  back abundance to all who share its shade.
