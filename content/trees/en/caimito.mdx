# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "low"
toxicParts:
  - "seeds"
  - "skin"
skinContactRisk: "low"
allergenRisk: "low"
structuralRisks: []
childSafe: false
petSafe: false
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "The RIPE FRUIT PULP is SAFE and EDIBLE for humans including children when properly prepared - it is sweet, hydrating, nutritious (vitamins, fiber). However, SEEDS contain cyanogenic glucosides that release TOXIC CYANIDE when metabolized. NEVER eat or chew seeds - swallowing seeds whole is also dangerous. SKIN/RIND contains bitter, sticky WHITE LATEX that is mildly toxic in quantity and not edible. Must remove ALL skin and seeds before consuming. UNRIPE FRUIT contains more latex and can be astringent or mildly irritating - only eat fully ripe fruit. CHILDREN: Safe as a treat with proper preparation (pulp only, no seeds/skin), but accidental ingestion of latex from skin or seeds with cyanide is dangerous. PETS: Limited evidence but seeds (cyanogenic compounds) and latex-containing skin/rind should be kept away from dogs, cats, and other pets. Even the pulp should only be offered in small amounts with veterinary approval, avoiding ALL seeds and skin."
skinContactDetails: "Cutting the fruit releases sticky white LATEX from the skin/rind - minimize contact between latex and edible pulp. The latex may cause MILD IRRITATION in sensitive individuals and should not be consumed. Individuals with LATEX ALLERGIES should exercise caution as contact with rind may trigger allergic reactions. Most people can handle the fruit without issues if they avoid prolonged contact with the latex."
allergenDetails: "LOW allergen risk overall but LATEX ALLERGY is a specific concern. Those allergic to latex should handle the fruit with care or avoid it entirely. Some people may experience mild allergic symptoms or digestive issues from the fruit's latex or skin. Most people tolerate the properly prepared fruit pulp without problems."
safetyNotes: "Star Apple (Caimito) is SAFE and DELICIOUS when prepared correctly but requires CAREFUL HANDLING. SAFE PREPARATION: Cut fruit and scoop out ONLY THE PULP with a spoon, carefully excluding ALL latex-containing skin/rind and ALL seeds. The pulp is safe for children as a treat in moderation with proper preparation. NEVER serve skin or seeds - these contain toxins. TRADITIONAL MEDICINE: Leaves, bark, and seeds are used in herbal medicine but are NOT safe for casual eating and can cause toxicity or irritation - only for trained practitioners. LATEX: The sticky white sap in skin is bitter, mildly toxic, and should not touch the edible pulp. SUMMARY: Delicious tropical fruit that is completely safe when properly prepared (pulp only, no seeds/skin). Popular throughout tropics with no issues when handled correctly. Keep seeds and rinds away from children and pets."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "moderate"
growthRateDetails: "2-3 ft/year; begins fruiting at 5-7 years from seed, 3-4 years from grafted"
matureSize: "15-25 m tall, crown spread 10-15 m diameter - becomes large tree"
hardiness: "Tropical lowlands (0-800m); prefers warm humid conditions, no frost tolerance"
soilRequirements: "Adaptable but prefers deep, well-drained loam with organic matter; pH 5.5-7.5; tolerates wide range"
waterNeeds: "moderate-to-high"
waterDetails: "Prefers consistent moisture. Water deeply 1-2 times per week during dry season. Young trees need regular watering for establishment. Once mature, reasonably drought-tolerant but produces better fruit with adequate water. Does not tolerate waterlogged soil."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plant 10-12 m from buildings and other trees; needs space for large crown"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
  - "grafting"
  - "air layering"
propagationDifficulty: "moderate"
plantingSeason: "Plant at start of rainy season (May-June); container trees can plant year-round with irrigation"
maintenanceNeeds: "Low maintenance once established. Prune young trees to develop strong structure. Minimal pruning needed at maturity except to remove dead branches or control size. Benefits from annual compost or balanced fertilizer. Fruit ripens January-April - ready when slightly soft to touch. Cut carefully to avoid latex. Very ornamental with bronze leaf undersides."
commonProblems:
  - "Fruit bats and birds compete for ripe fruit - harvest promptly"
  - "Fruit drop when overripe - check trees regularly during season"
  - "Scale insects and mealybugs on branches - treat with horticultural oil"
  - "Root rot in poorly drained soils - ensure good drainage"
  - "Slow to fruit from seed - grafted trees recommended for faster production"

### Growing Star Apple

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Climate Requirements">
    **Ideal Conditions**: - Tropical lowlands to mid-elevations - Frost-free
    areas essential - High humidity preferred - 1,500-3,000 mm annual rainfall -
    Even distribution or irrigation **Temperature**: - Optimal: 25-32°C -
    Minimum: 10°C (brief cold only) - Frost: Will not tolerate
  </AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Propagation">
  **From Seed**: - Fresh seeds germinate in 3-4 weeks - Seedlings variable in
  quality - Takes 5-10 years to fruit **Vegetative** (preferred): - Air layering
  common - Grafting for named varieties - Fruiting in 3-4 years - Ensures fruit
  quality **Planting**: - Space 10-12m apart - Deep planting hole - Stake young
  trees - Water regularly first 2 years
</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Care and Harvest">
  **Maintenance**: - Responds well to fertilization - Light pruning for shape -
  Mulching beneficial - Few serious pest problems **Harvest**: - Pick when fruit
  softens slightly - Color change indicates ripeness - Handle carefully (bruises
  easily) - Ripen at room temperature - Refrigerate when ripe
</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Companion Planting">
    **Beneficial Companions**:
    - **Nitrogen-fixers**: Poró (*Erythrina*), *Inga* species - improve soil fertility for Sapotaceae family
    - **Groundcovers**: Ginger family, calathea - moisture retention and weed suppression
    - **Compatible understory**: Shade-tolerant plants thrive under mature caimito canopy
    - **Windbreaks**: Bamboo, tall grasses - protect from wind damage (important for fruit set)

    **Compatible Fruit Trees (spacing 10-15m)**:
    - Zapote/Mamey Sapote - same family (Sapotaceae), similar needs
    - Níspero - family member, compatible moisture requirements
    - Mango - different family, similar tropical lowland adaptation
    - Rambután - complementary fruiting season

    **Plants to Avoid**:
    - Citrus family - different nutrient requirements
    - Allelopathic species (eucalyptus, black walnut)
    - Shallow-rooted aggressive competitors

    **Traditional Agroforestry**:
    - **Caribbean Home Gardens**: Classic patio tree in Limón and Caribbean lowlands, mixed with cacao and peach palm
    - **Shade Tree Systems**: Mature trees provide filtered shade for coffee (older plantings, 15+ years)
    - **Ornamental-Productive**: Dual purpose - beautiful golden-leaf undersides + delicious fruit
    - **Wildlife Gardens**: Fruits attract numerous bird species, seed-dispersers

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Seasonal Care Calendar">
    ### December-February (Dry Season - Veranillo)
    - Regular watering for young trees (0-5 years): weekly deep watering
    - Mature trees: biweekly if prolonged dry spell
    - Monitor for water stress (leaf wilting indicates need)
    - Fertilize with balanced formula (10-10-10) + micronutrients
    - **Fruiting varies by variety**: Some varieties fruit now

    ### March-April (Pre-Rainy Season)
    - **Peak flowering for many varieties**: August-October flowers set fruit now
    - Fruit development begins (3-4 month maturation)
    - Reduce irrigation gradually as rains begin
    - Apply compost/organic matter around drip line
    - Light pruning after fruiting (shape young trees)

    ### May-August (Rainy Season - Invierno)
    - Natural rainfall sufficient - cease irrigation
    - **Peak fruiting period: May-June** for many varieties
    - Daily harvest checks - fruits soften when ripe
    - Monitor for fruit rot (rare, good drainage prevents)
    - Weed management important (vigorous rainy season growth)

    ### September-November (Late Rainy/Early Dry)
    - **Flowering begins**: August-October peak flowering for many varieties
    - Late-season fruits ripen
    - Propagation window: Air layering success highest now
    - Prepare for dry season (mulch application)
    - Assess tree health, plan any corrective pruning

    **Critical Notes**:
    - Caimito flowers/fruits on old wood - avoid heavy pruning
    - Fruit does NOT ripen after picking - must be mature when harvested
    - Color change + slight softness = harvest indicator
    - Grafted trees fruit 3-4 years; seedlings 5-10+ years
    - Despite common name "Star Apple", fruits cause no allergies (unlike true apples)
    - Golden leaf undersides make tree ornamental even when not fruiting
