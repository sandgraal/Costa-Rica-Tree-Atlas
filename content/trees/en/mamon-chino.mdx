description: "The Mamón Chino (Rambutan) is a striking Southeast Asian fruit tree that produces clusters of hairy red fruits with sweet, translucent white flesh. Though native to Malaysia and Indonesia, this relative of the lychee has thrived in Costa Rica's Caribbean lowlands since the early 20th century, becoming one of the country's most distinctive seasonal fruits. The name 'mamón chino' (Chinese mamón) reflects both its Asian origin and its similarity to the native Spanish lime."

toxicityDetails: "The fruit flesh is completely safe and widely consumed worldwide. However, the SEEDS should not be eaten raw. Raw rambutan seeds contain saponins, tannins, and other compounds that can cause gastrointestinal upset. Some studies suggest seeds may have hypoglycemic effects (lower blood sugar). In Southeast Asian traditional medicine, roasted seeds are sometimes used, but this is not recommended without expert guidance. The fruit flesh itself is nutritious and safe for all ages."
skinContactDetails: "No known skin contact risks. The soft 'hairs' on the fruit exterior are harmless and not irritating. Safe to handle."
allergenDetails: "Allergies to rambutan are rare but possible, as with any fruit. Individuals with lychee or longan allergies may have cross-reactivity. Most people can safely consume rambutan without allergic reactions."
safetyNotes: "This is a safe fruit tree for families. The flesh is delicious and nutritious. The only caution: teach children not to eat the seeds—only eat the white flesh around the seed. Spit out or remove the seed before eating. The seed is large and obvious, making accidental ingestion unlikely. Overall, this is one of the safest fruit trees you can grow."
wildlifeRisks: "Safe for wildlife. Birds and mammals consume the fruit. The flesh is safe for pets if they consume dropped fruit, but keep seeds away from dogs as a precaution."

# Mamón Chino (Rambutan)

<Callout type="success" title="Asia's Gift to Costa Rica">
  The **Mamón Chino** (_Nephelium lappaceum_), known internationally as
  Rambutan, is one of the most visually exotic fruits found in Costa Rica. Its
  striking appearance—red or yellow skin covered in soft, hair-like spines—makes
  it instantly recognizable. Native to Southeast Asia, the rambutan was
  introduced to Costa Rica's Caribbean lowlands in the early 1900s and found the
  humid climate of Limón Province ideal. Today, Costa Rica has become a
  significant producer, and mamón chino season brings these hairy jewels to
  markets nationwide. The name literally means "Chinese mamón," reflecting both
  its Asian origins and its resemblance to the native Spanish lime in how it's
  eaten.

## History in Costa Rica

<FeatureBox title="How Rambutan Came to Costa Rica" icon="🚢">
  **Timeline of Introduction**:

- **Early 1900s**: First trees brought to Costa Rica
- **1909-1913**: German immigrants plant rambutan in Limón Province
- **Mid-20th century**: Trees spread through Caribbean lowlands
- **1970s-80s**: Commercial production begins
- **1990s-present**: Costa Rica becomes major Western Hemisphere producer

**Why It Thrived**:
The Caribbean lowlands of Limón Province offer conditions remarkably similar to the rambutan's Southeast Asian homeland:

- High rainfall (3000-4000 mm/year)
- Warm temperatures year-round
- High humidity
- Rich volcanic soils

Today, Costa Rica is the largest rambutan producer in the Americas!

## Cultivation

### Growing Mamón Chino in Costa Rica

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Site Selection">
    **Ideal Conditions**:
    - Caribbean lowland climate
    - High rainfall, no dry season
    - Deep, fertile soil
    - Protected from strong winds
    - Full sun to partial shade

    **Best regions**: Limón Province, Sarapiquí, Northern Zone

    **Challenges in other areas**:
    - Pacific side: dry season stress
    - Central Valley: too cool at higher elevations

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Propagation">
    **Budding/Grafting** (commercial):
    - Ensures variety and quality
    - Fruiting in 2-4 years
    - Use vigorous seedling rootstock
    - Patch or chip budding common

    **Air Layering**:
    - Produces true-to-type trees
    - Slower than grafting
    - 3-4 years to fruit

    **From Seed**:
    - Used for rootstock only
    - Variable fruit quality
    - 5-8 years to fruit
    - Unknown sex until flowering

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Orchard Management">
    **Spacing**: 10-12 meters between trees

    **Irrigation**: Essential in areas with dry periods

    **Fertilization**: Regular NPK applications, especially during fruiting

    **Pruning**: Shape young trees; maintain accessible canopy height

    **Pest management**:
    - Fruit flies (major pest)
    - Bagging fruit common practice
    - Postharvest treatment for export
