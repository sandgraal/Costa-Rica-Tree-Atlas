# Matapalo (Strangler Figs)

<Callout type="success" title="The Stranglers That Feed the Forest">
  **Matapalos** (literally "tree-killers") are the strangler figs of Costa
  Rica—members of the genus _Ficus_ with one of nature's most remarkable life
  strategies. These trees begin life as epiphytes, germinating from bird-dropped
  seeds high in the forest canopy. They send roots cascading earthward,
  eventually enveloping their host tree in a woody embrace that slowly strangles
  it to death. Yet despite this seemingly sinister behavior, strangler figs are
  among the **most important trees in tropical ecosystems**—their figs feed
  hundreds of species of birds, mammals, and insects, sustaining wildlife
  year-round when other food is scarce. To understand tropical forests is to
  understand the Matapalo.

## The Strangling Life Cycle

<FeatureBox title="How Stranglers Work" icon="🌱">
  The strangler fig life cycle is one of nature's most dramatic: **Stage 1:
  Aerial Beginning** - Bird or bat eats fig elsewhere - Deposits seed (with
  fertilizer!) on branch high in canopy - Seed germinates as EPIPHYTE on host
  tree - Young fig is harmless—just a small plant **Stage 2: The Roots Descend**
  - Fig sends aerial roots down toward ground - Roots can drop 20-30+ meters! -
  Once they reach soil, growth accelerates - More and more roots follow **Stage
  3: The Embrace** - Roots anastomose (fuse together) - Form lattice around host
  trunk - Crown expands, shading host - Roots compete for water and nutrients
  **Stage 4: The Slow Kill** - Host tree gradually weakens - Dies over years to
  decades - Host rots away inside lattice - Fig becomes FREE-STANDING with
  hollow trunk **The Result**: - Hollow lattice trunk (climbable!) - Fig
  occupies former host's canopy position - New "tree" made of fused roots - Host
  completely absorbed This process takes 50-100+ years!
</FeatureBox>

<Callout type="warning" title="Not Always Deadly">
  Not every fig encounter kills the host: **Sometimes hosts survive**: - Host
  may be too large/vigorous - Fig may grow alongside rather than around - Some
  host species are more resistant **Not all figs strangle**: - Some Costa Rican
  Ficus are "normal" trees - Start from seeds on ground - Never develop
  strangling behavior - "Free-standing" figs The strangler strategy is
  remarkable but not universal!

## Physical Description

### Form and Structure

Mature strangler figs are massive trees with distinctive architecture—their trunks are often a lattice of fused aerial roots rather than solid wood, and large buttresses may extend outward.

## Ecological Importance

### The Keystone Species

<Callout type="success" title="Why Figs Are Keystones">
  Strangler figs are considered **keystone species**—their removal would cause
  cascading ecosystem collapse: **Food Timing**: - Figs fruit YEAR-ROUND - Not
  synchronized to season - Individual trees fruit at different times - Provide
  food when everything else is scarce **The Numbers**: - 70+ bird species eat
  figs in Costa Rica - 30+ mammal species depend on figs - Countless insects
  involved - Fish eat fallen figs! **Nutritional Value**: - High in calcium -
  Good sugar content - Soft, easily digested - Seeds pass through animals **The
  Test**: - Remove figs from ecosystem - Many species would starve - Especially
  in dry season/lean times - Cascading effects throughout food web No other tree
  genus provides such consistent, year-round food for such diversity of
  wildlife!
</Callout>

### Wildlife Dependent on Figs

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Mammals

- **Spider monkeys**: Major fig eaters
- **Howler monkeys**: Important food source
- **White-faced capuchins**: Frequent fig visitors
- **Fruit bats**: Night-time dispersers
- **Kinkajous**: Nocturnal fig consumers
- **Agoutis**: Eat fallen figs
- **Peccaries**: Ground foragers

</Column>
<Column>

#### Birds

- **Toucans**: Major dispersers (all species)
- **Parrots**: Especially green macaws
- **Trogons**: Frequent visitors
- **Tanagers**: Many species
- **Orioles**: Attracted to ripe figs
- **Thrushes**: Clay-colored, others
- **Pigeons/Doves**: Ground and canopy

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

### The Fig Wasp Mutualism

<FeatureBox title="Figs and Their Wasps" icon="🐝">
  Every Ficus species has its own specific pollinating wasp: **The
  Relationship**: - Each fig species = one wasp species - Wasp enters fig
  through tiny pore (ostiole) - Pollinates flowers INSIDE the fig - Lays eggs
  inside some flowers - Wasp offspring develop inside fig - New wasps emerge,
  carrying pollen to next fig **The Dependency**: - Figs CANNOT reproduce
  without their wasp - Wasps CANNOT reproduce without their fig - Obligate
  mutualism—neither survives alone - Co-evolved over millions of years
  **Conservation Implication**: - Save the fig, save the wasp - Save the wasp,
  save the fig - Lose either, lose both - Plus all the species that depend on
  figs! This is one of the most intimate plant-animal relationships in nature!

<Callout type="success" title="The Giving Killers">
  There is something almost mythological about the strangler fig—a tree that
  begins as an innocent seed dropped in bird droppings, grows into an embracing
  presence around its host, and slowly, over decades, squeezes the life from the
  very tree that gave it a home. It sounds like a villain's origin story. Yet
  the Matapalo is no villain; it is, in fact, one of the forest's greatest
  benefactors. When other trees fruit briefly and seasonally, the strangler figs
  fruit year-round, sustaining monkeys and toucans, bats and butterflies,
  through the lean times when nothing else offers food. Without figs, scientists
  estimate, a significant percentage of tropical fruit-eating animals would
  vanish. The hollow trunk that remains after the host has rotted away becomes
  shelter for countless creatures. The massive crown provides shade and habitat.
  Even in death, the strangler gives life. Stand inside one of these hollow
  lattice trunks, look up through the cathedral of living roots, and you
  understand: this is not a tree that kills—this is a tree that transforms death
  into abundance, parasitism into generosity, strangling into sustaining. The
  Matapalo teaches us that in nature, as in life, the line between taking and
  giving is never as clear as it seems.
