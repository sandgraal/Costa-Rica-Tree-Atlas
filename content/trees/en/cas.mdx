# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "none"
skinContactRisk: "none"
allergenRisk: "none"
childSafe: true
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "Cas fruit is completely safe to eat and has been consumed in Costa Rica for generations. It is in the Myrtaceae family (same as guava and eucalyptus). No toxic compounds have been identified. Safe for all ages. The fruit is very tart/sour so rarely eaten raw, but perfectly safe when sweetened in juice or other preparations."
skinContactDetails: "No skin irritation from handling fruit or tree. Completely safe. The fruit has a slightly rough peel but is harmless to touch."
allergenDetails: "Allergic reactions are extremely rare. Myrtaceae family is generally well-tolerated. No significant allergen concerns documented for cas fruit. Some individuals allergic to guava might theoretically react, but this is very uncommon."
safetyNotes: "COMPLETELY SAFE FRUIT: This is one of Costa Rica's safest native fruits. No toxicity concerns whatsoever. Perfect for children, pregnant women, elderly, and anyone else. The fruit's intense sourness is its only 'defense' - add sugar and enjoy! A great tree for home gardens, schools, and public spaces. Seeds are also safe if accidentally swallowed."
wildlifeRisks: "Safe for all animals. Birds, mammals, and insects eat the fruit without harm. Safe for pets and livestock. Can be shared with dogs and other pets (though they may not enjoy the sourness!)."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "moderate"
growthRateDetails: "2-3 ft/year; begins fruiting at 3-4 years from seed, 2 years from grafted plants"
matureSize: "5-8 m tall, crown spread 4-6 m diameter - compact fruit tree"
hardiness: "Highland tropical (500-2000m); prefers cooler temperatures than lowland guavas"
soilRequirements: "Adaptable to various soils; prefers well-drained with organic matter; pH 5.5-7.0"
waterNeeds: "moderate"
waterDetails: "Moderate water needs. Water regularly during establishment (first year). Once established, can tolerate short dry periods but produces more fruit with consistent moisture. Deep watering weekly during dry season encourages better fruiting."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plant 4-5 m from buildings and other trees; suitable for smaller gardens"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
  - "grafting"
  - "cuttings"
propagationDifficulty: "easy"
plantingSeason: "Plant at start of rainy season (May-June) for best establishment"
maintenanceNeeds: "Low to moderate maintenance. Prune after harvest to maintain shape and size. Remove crossed or rubbing branches. Benefits from annual application of compost or balanced fertilizer. Very productive - can yield 30-50 kg fruit per mature tree annually. Harvest fruits when yellow-green and aromatic (June-September peak season)."
commonProblems:
  - "Fruit flies - common pest, bag fruit or harvest promptly when ripe"
  - "Anthracnose disease on fruit - ensure good air circulation through pruning"
  - "Mediterranean fruit fly damage - monitor and use traps if needed"
  - "Overripe fruit drops and attracts wasps - harvest regularly"
  - "Birds may peck fruit - netting can help if problem is severe"

# Cas (Costa Rican Guava)

<Callout type="success" title="Costa Rica's Signature Fruit">
  The **Cas** (_Psidium friedrichsthalianum_), known as Costa Rican Guava or
  Sour Guava, is perhaps the most distinctly Costa Rican fruit tree. While the
  common guava is eaten fresh throughout the tropics, the cas has carved its own
  niche—its intensely tart, aromatic fruits are transformed into *refresco de
  cas*, one of the most iconic and refreshing beverages in Costa Rican cuisine.
  Found primarily in Costa Rica and Panama's highlands, this small tree
  represents a unique piece of Central American biodiversity and culinary
  heritage. No visit to a Costa Rican *soda* (local restaurant) is complete
  without trying this uniquely tangy, fragrant drink.

## Cultural Significance

### In Costa Rican Identity

<FeatureBox title="A Uniquely Costa Rican Fruit" icon="🇨🇷">
  The cas holds a special place in Costa Rican culture:

- **National beverage**: Refresco de cas is quintessentially Tico
- **Home gardens**: Found in patios throughout the Central Valley
- **Soda culture**: No traditional restaurant is complete without it
- **Childhood memories**: Many Costa Ricans associate it with home
- **Local pride**: A fruit that's "ours" - not found widely elsewhere

The intense tartness that foreigners find surprising is exactly what Costa Ricans love about it!

</FeatureBox>

### Cultural & Historical Context

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Pre-Columbian Heritage">
    Indigenous peoples of the Central Valley and highland regions gathered wild cas fruits long before European contact. Archaeological evidence from sites in the Reventazón and Tárcoles river basins suggests that *Psidium* species were among the wild fruits regularly consumed by pre-Columbian populations. The fruit's intense sourness made it a natural flavoring agent, and its medicinal properties were recognized in traditional healing practices.
  </AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Colonial & Modern History">
  During the colonial period, cas remained a local fruit of little commercial
  interest to Spanish settlers focused on cacao and coffee. It was the growth of
  Costa Rica's unique _soda_ culture in the 20th century that elevated cas to
  iconic status. As small family-run eateries spread across the country,
  refresco de cas became a staple alongside gallo pinto and casados. Today,
  industrial processing of cas pulp has expanded availability, with frozen pulp
  exported to Costa Rican diaspora communities in the United States.
</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Cas in Contemporary Culture">
    In modern Costa Rica, cas has transcended its role as a simple fruit:

    - **Festivals**: Local harvest festivals (_ferias_) in the Central Valley celebrate cas season (June–September)
    - **Gastronomy**: Chef-driven restaurants now feature cas in craft cocktails, ceviches, and dessert sauces
    - **Identity marker**: Offering a foreign visitor refresco de cas is a point of cultural pride
    - **Agricultural heritage**: Backyard cas trees are passed down through generations, connecting families to their rural roots
    - **Artisanal products**: Small producers create cas vinegar, cas wine, and cas hot sauce

  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

### Market Presence

<DataTable
  headers={["Channel", "Products", "Season/Availability"]}

## Conservation Status

<Callout type="info" title="Conservation Notes">
  **Status**: Least Concern (LC)

The cas is not threatened, but its limited natural range makes genetic conservation important. Most trees are cultivated rather than wild. Maintaining diversity in cultivated populations helps preserve this unique species.
