toxicityDetails: "Orey (Campnosperma panamense) is in the Anacardiaceae family, which includes cashew, mango, and poison ivy. However, Orey appears to have low toxicity levels. No significant ingestion hazards documented, though as with other Anacardiaceae, caution is warranted. Not considered a dangerous tree, but family relationship suggests mild caution. Generally safe in landscapes."
skinContactDetails: "As a member of Anacardiaceae, Orey may contain trace amounts of urushiol or similar compounds in sap and bark. Most people can handle the tree without reaction. Some sensitive individuals (especially those with cashew, mango, or poison ivy allergies) may experience mild contact dermatitis. The tree is much less aggressive than poison ivy relatives. Wash skin if sap contact occurs. Serious reactions are uncommon."
allergenDetails: "Individuals with strong allergies to other Anacardiaceae (cashew, mango, poison ivy) should exercise caution. Cross-reactivity possible but typically mild. Most people tolerate contact without issue. Wood dust may cause respiratory irritation during processing (use protective equipment)."
structuralRiskDetails: "Medium tree (25-35 meters) with distinctive stilt roots. The stilt roots create uneven ground and trip hazards at tree base. Branches can fall during storms. Grows in wetland areas where footing may be unstable. Consider these factors when planting near paths or structures."
safetyNotes: "Orey is generally safe but deserves mild respect as an Anacardiaceae. The tree is much less problematic than poison ivy relatives and has been used traditionally without major safety issues. Most people can enjoy this tree without problems. The main caution is for individuals with known strong allergies to other Anacardiaceae. The stilt roots are visually interesting but create physical trip hazards. Overall, this is a safe wetland tree appropriate for restoration and landscapes."
wildlifeRisks: "Safe for wildlife. Important wetland habitat tree. No significant toxic effects on animals documented."

# Orey

<Callout type="success" title="Master of the Swamps">
  **Orey** (_Campnosperma panamense_) is a remarkable wetland specialist that
  dominates the flooded forests of Costa Rica's Caribbean lowlands. With its
  distinctive stilt roots and ability to thrive in permanently waterlogged
  conditions, it represents one of nature's most specialized tree adaptations.

<AccordionItem title="🔬 Taxonomic Notes">

_Campnosperma_ is a small genus of about 10 species, mostly found in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, with _C. panamense_ being the only American representative. The genus name means "curved seed" (Greek: kamptos = curved, sperma = seed).

**Family Connection**: As a member of Anacardiaceae, Orey is related to mangoes, cashews, and pistachios, though it shares none of their edible qualities.

**Unique Distribution**: The presence of this genus in the Americas represents a fascinating biogeographic puzzle, suggesting ancient connections across continents.
