# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "moderate"
toxicParts:
  - "seeds"
skinContactRisk: "none"
allergenRisk: "none"
structuralRisks: []
childSafe: false
petSafe: false
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "Seeds contain toxic acetogenins (annonacin and related compounds) and MUST NEVER be eaten. While the fruit flesh is safe and delicious, seeds are poisonous and can cause severe gastrointestinal distress, vomiting, and neurological symptoms if consumed. Like other Annona species, seeds have been traditionally used as insecticides and fish poison, demonstrating their toxicity. Children must be carefully supervised and taught to spit out all seeds when eating the fruit. Remove all seeds before giving fruit to children. The toxic acetogenins in seeds are water-soluble and can leach into surrounding tissue if seeds are crushed."
skinContactDetails: "No skin irritation reported. Fruit flesh and skin are safe to handle. The creamy flesh can stain hands slightly but washes off easily."
allergenDetails: "No significant allergenic compounds identified in fruit flesh. Rare cases of oral sensitivity have been reported in individuals allergic to other tropical fruits. The fruit is generally well-tolerated."
structuralRiskDetails: "No structural risks. This is a medium-sized tree with moderately strong branching. Branches are flexible and rarely break. The spreading crown provides good shade but does not pose hazards."
safetyNotes: "Fruit flesh is SAFE and nutritious—rich in vitamin C, B vitamins, and antioxidants. Seeds are TOXIC—always remove completely before consumption. Never swallow seeds whole or chew them. Traditional medicinal uses of crushed seeds should only be done with expert guidance. Seeds contain annonacin and other acetogenins toxic to insects and harmful to humans and domestic animals if ingested. Teach children proper seed removal. Some researchers caution against excessive consumption of Annona fruits due to potential neurotoxic effects of acetogenins, though this primarily concerns seeds and concentrated extracts, not occasional fruit consumption."
wildlifeRisks: "Seeds are toxic to most domestic animals including dogs, cats, and birds. Monkeys, bats, and some wild birds naturally consume the fruit and disperse seeds safely, but pets should not be allowed access to seeds. Fruit pulp is generally safe for wildlife."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "moderate"
growthRateDetails: "2-3 ft/year (60-90 cm/year); begins fruiting at 4-6 years from seed, 3-4 years from grafted plants. Growth accelerates with consistent moisture and fertile soil."
matureSize: "10-15 m tall, crown spread 6-9 m diameter - medium fruit tree with spreading habit"
hardiness: "Tropical humid lowlands (0-1200m); sensitive to cold, no frost tolerance, prefers consistently warm, humid conditions"
soilRequirements: "Adaptable but prefers deep, fertile, well-drained soils rich in organic matter; tolerates clay if drainage is adequate; pH 5.5-7.0. Benefits from mulching to maintain soil moisture and fertility."
waterNeeds: "high"
waterDetails: "Requires regular, consistent moisture year-round. Unlike some Annona species, does NOT tolerate extended dry periods well—native to wet tropical forests. Water deeply 2-3 times per week during dry season, weekly during wet season. Mulch heavily to retain moisture. Young trees need frequent watering for first 2-3 years. Drought stress reduces fruit size and quality significantly. Best performance in areas with >2000 mm annual rainfall or with irrigation."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plant 8-10 m from buildings and other trees; needs more space than common anona due to larger mature size and spreading crown"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
  - "grafting"
  - "air layering"
propagationDifficulty: "moderate"
plantingSeason: "Plant at start of rainy season (May-June) for best establishment. Can plant year-round if irrigation is available."
maintenanceNeeds: "Moderate maintenance. Prune annually to maintain shape, improve air circulation, and remove dead or crossing branches. Benefits from heavy mulching (10-15 cm depth) to maintain moisture and suppress weeds. Apply compost or balanced organic fertilizer 3-4 times annually. Hand pollination can significantly improve fruit set—transfer pollen in early morning when flowers are receptive. Fruit typically ready July-November when skin darkens and fruit softens slightly. Harvest by cutting stem with pruners when fruit begins to soften. Tree is briefly deciduous or semi-deciduous during short dry periods."
commonProblems:
  - "Fruit flies (Anastrepha spp.) - major pest, use bagging or harvest promptly when ripe"
  - "Anthracnose (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides) - fungal disease, prune for air circulation"
  - "Poor fruit set - hand pollination improves success rate significantly"
  - "Fruit drop from water stress - maintain consistent moisture, mulch heavily"
  - "Scale insects - treat with horticultural oil if infestation is severe"
  - "Root rot in poorly drained soils - plant in raised beds if necessary"

# Anona Colorada (Red Custard Apple)

<Callout type="success" title="The Wild Anona with Red Flesh">
  The **Anona Colorada** (_Annona purpurea_), also called Soncoya or Red Custard
  Apple, is a magnificent wild fruit tree native to the wet lowland forests of
  Central America. This lesser-known member of the Annona family produces
  remarkably large fruits—often exceeding 20 cm in diameter—with distinctive
  red-purple flesh that gives the tree its Spanish name "colorada" (reddish).
  While less cultivated than its relatives (guanábana and common anona), the
  Anona Colorada is prized by those who know it for its sweet, aromatic flesh
  with subtle floral notes. In Costa Rica, the tree grows naturally in Pacific
  and Caribbean lowland forests and occasionally appears in local markets during
  its season, commanding premium prices.

## Ecology and Habitat

### Forest Role

_Annona purpurea_ plays an important role in wet tropical forest ecosystems as a mid-canopy fruiting tree that provides food for wildlife during its extended fruiting season (July-November).

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Ecological Functions

- **Food source**: Fruits feed monkeys, bats, birds, coatis, agoutis
- **Seed dispersal**: Large seeds dispersed by mammals (monkeys, tapirs in intact forests)
- **Pollinator support**: Flowers provide food for beetle pollinators
- **Canopy layer**: Contributes to forest structure
- **Pioneer potential**: Can establish in secondary forests

</Column>
<Column>

#### Wildlife Interactions

**Pollinators**:

- Nitidulid beetles (primary pollinators)
- Other beetle species attracted to fermenting flower scent
- Hand pollination often needed in cultivation

**Seed Dispersers**:

- White-faced capuchin monkeys
- Howler monkeys
- Coatis (Nasua narica)
- Agoutis (Dasyprocta punctata)
- Fruit-eating bats
- Crested guans and other large birds

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

### Reproductive Biology

<Callout type="info" title="Pollination Biology">
  Like other Annona species, *A. purpurea* has a two-stage pollination process called 
  **protogyny**:

1. **Female phase** (2-3 hours early morning): Stigmas are receptive; flower is slightly open and emits strong, sweet scent to attract beetles. Temperature inside flower increases slightly.
2. **Male phase** (next day or later same day): Stamens release pollen; flower opens wider.

This mechanism promotes cross-pollination but can result in poor fruit set without abundant beetle pollinators. In cultivation, hand pollination dramatically improves yields. Collect pollen from male-phase flowers in early morning and apply to receptive stigmas of female-phase flowers using a soft brush.

</Callout>

### Traditional Medicine

In traditional medicine systems of Central America, various parts of _Annona purpurea_ have been used, though scientific validation is limited.

<Callout type="warning" title="Traditional Use—Caution Required">
  **Fruit pulp** (no seeds): Considered nutritious and safe; no medicinal claims beyond general health benefits of fresh fruit.

**Seeds** (TOXIC): Traditionally crushed and used externally as:

- Insecticide for crop pests
- Fish poison for traditional fishing (now illegal)
- Head lice treatment (extremely cautious external use only)

**Bark and leaves**: Limited traditional use; some reports of decoctions for digestive issues (not scientifically validated).

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT attempt traditional medicinal uses without expert guidance. Seeds are POISONOUS if ingested. Modern medicine offers safer alternatives for all conditions traditionally treated with Annona preparations.

</Callout>

### Modern Research Interest

Recent scientific research on Annona species, including _A. purpurea_, focuses on:

- **Acetogenin compounds**: Found in seeds, leaves, and bark; showing potential anticancer and pesticidal properties in laboratory studies
- **Antioxidant activity**: Fruit flesh contains phenolic compounds with antioxidant effects
- **Antimicrobial properties**: Extracts from leaves and seeds show activity against some pathogens
- **Neurotoxicity concerns**: Excessive consumption of Annona seeds or concentrated extracts may be linked to atypical Parkinsonism in some populations (primarily concerning habitual consumers of seed-containing preparations, not occasional fruit consumption)

<Callout type="info">
  While *A. purpurea* has potential pharmaceutical applications, casual fruit
  consumption (with seeds properly removed) poses no identified health risks and
  provides nutritional benefits.

✅ **Warm tropical climate** (24-32°C year-round, no frost)  
✅ **High rainfall or irrigation** (2000+ mm/year, consistently moist)  
✅ **Wet lowland conditions** (0-1200m elevation)  
✅ **Patience** (4-6 years from seed to first fruit)

❌ **Will NOT thrive in**:

- Dry climates without heavy irrigation
- Areas with cool winters
- Highland areas above 1200m
- Locations with hard freezes or frosts

If your area has a pronounced dry season, choose _Annona reticulata_ (common anona) or _A. muricata_ (guanábana) instead—they tolerate drought better.

</Callout>

### Propagation

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### From Seed (Most Common)

**Advantages**: Easy, inexpensive, widely accessible  
**Disadvantages**: Slow to fruit (4-6 years), variable fruit quality

**Process**:

1. Collect seeds from ripe, high-quality fruit
2. Clean pulp from seeds immediately (ferment overnight if needed)
3. Plant FRESH within 1-2 weeks (viability drops rapidly)
4. Plant 1-2 cm deep in well-draining potting mix
5. Keep warm (25-30°C) and moist
6. Germination: 30-60 days (can be slow and erratic)
7. Transplant seedlings when 20-30 cm tall

**Seed storage**: Seeds lose viability within weeks; DO NOT dry seeds—plant fresh or store in moist medium for short periods only.

</Column>
<Column>

#### Grafting (Recommended for Improved Quality)

**Advantages**: Faster fruiting (3-4 years), consistent fruit quality  
**Disadvantages**: Requires skill, rootstock, and scion material

**Rootstocks**:

- _Annona glabra_ (Pond Apple): Tolerates wet, heavy soils; good vigor
- _Annona muricata_ (Guanábana): Good compatibility, disease resistance
- _Annona reticulata_ (Common Anona): Moderate success

**Grafting methods**:

- Cleft grafting (most common)
- Veneer grafting
- Budding (shield budding)

**Timing**: Best during active growth (early wet season)

#### Air Layering

Possible but labor-intensive; roots develop in 2-3 months on healthy branches. Results in larger plants faster than seeds but is time-consuming.

**Planting Steps**:

1. **Timing**: Plant at start of rainy season (May-June in Costa Rica) or year-round with irrigation
2. **Site prep**: Clear weeds in 2 m radius around planting site
3. **Hole**: Dig 60 cm x 60 cm x 60 cm; mix excavated soil with 2-3 buckets of compost
4. **Planting depth**: Plant at same depth as in container; don't bury trunk
5. **Water**: Water deeply immediately after planting
6. **Mulch**: Apply 10-15 cm thick organic mulch in 1.5 m radius (keep mulch 10 cm away from trunk to prevent rot)
7. **Stake**: Stake young trees if windy; remove stakes after 6-12 months

### Care and Maintenance

#### Watering

<Callout type="warning" title="Critical: Consistent Moisture Required">
  Unlike some Annona species, *A. purpurea* does NOT tolerate drought well.
  Consistent moisture is ESSENTIAL for good growth and fruit production.
</Callout>

- **Young trees (0-3 years)**: Water 2-3 times per week, more in dry weather
- **Established trees**: Water deeply once per week in rainy season, 2-3 times per week in dry season
- **Fruiting season**: Increase watering—consistent moisture improves fruit size and prevents fruit drop
- **Mulching**: Maintain thick (10-15 cm) organic mulch layer to retain moisture

#### Fertilization

      "During flowering, follow package rates",
    ],
  ]}
/>

**Organic options**: Compost, aged manure, bone meal, rock phosphate, wood ash (for potassium)

#### Pruning

- **Young trees (0-3 years)**: Train to central leader or open vase shape; remove crossing branches
- **Mature trees**: Prune annually (late dry season/early wet season) to:
  - Maintain desired height (3-4 m for easier harvest)
  - Improve air circulation (reduces anthracnose)
  - Remove dead, diseased, or crossing wood
  - Thin dense canopy to allow light penetration
- **Fruiting wood**: Flowers form on older wood and trunk; don't over-prune

#### Hand Pollination (Recommended for Best Yields)

<FeatureBox title="Hand Pollination Technique" icon="🌺">
  **Why hand pollinate?**: Beetle pollinators may be scarce in cultivation, resulting in poor fruit set. Hand pollination can double or triple yields.

**Steps**:

1. **Identify female-phase flowers (early morning, 6-8 AM)**: Slightly open, strong scent, stigmas visible and moist/receptive
2. **Collect pollen**: Find male-phase flowers (more open, stamens shedding yellow pollen). Collect pollen on soft brush or Q-tip.
3. **Transfer pollen**: Gently brush pollen onto stigmas of female-phase flowers
4. **Timing**: Pollinate in early morning when flowers are most receptive
5. **Repeat**: Do this daily during flowering season for best results

**Results**: Properly pollinated flowers develop into fruits within weeks. Not all pollinated flowers will set fruit—some natural drop is normal.

### Harvesting

**Timing**: July-November (peak August-October in Costa Rica)

**Indicators of readiness**:

- Fruit begins to soften slightly (yields to gentle thumb pressure)
- Skin color darkens from green to purplish-brown
- Strong aromatic fragrance
- Areoles (fruit segments) may start to separate slightly

**Harvest method**:

- Use pruners to cut stem (don't pull or twist—damages tree and fruit)
- Harvest when fruit JUST begins to soften
- Can harvest slightly underripe—will ripen off tree in 1-3 days
- Handle gently—bruises easily

**Post-harvest**:

- Ripen at room temperature if harvested slightly underripe
- Refrigerate ripe fruit if not eating immediately (keeps 2-3 days)
- Wash hands after handling—flesh can stain skin pink/red

**Expected yield**: Mature tree (10+ years) can produce 50-150 fruits per year, depending on care, pollination success, and climate.

## Agroforestry and Companion Planting

_Annona purpurea_ fits well into diverse agroforestry systems in wet tropical lowlands.

### Suitable Systems

- **Shade-grown coffee**: Provides shade and fruit; requires pruning to manage shade levels
- **Cacao agroforestry**: Medium-sized shade tree; non-competitive root system; nitrogen-fixing companions (Inga spp.) recommended
- **Home gardens**: Ornamental and productive; medium size suits home landscapes
- **Living fences and borders**: Can be planted along property lines; needs space
- **Multi-story fruit orchards**: Integrates with shorter trees (citrus, sapote) and taller timber species

## Where to See Anona Colorada in Costa Rica

_Annona purpurea_ is less commonly encountered than its cultivated relatives, but can be found:

### Wild/Natural Areas

- **Corcovado National Park (Osa Peninsula)**: Occurs naturally in wet lowland forests
- **Piedras Blancas National Park (Osa Peninsula)**: Wet forests
- **Tortuguero National Park (Caribbean)**: Occasionally in wet forests
- **Carara National Park**: Transition forest areas
- **Private reserves** in wet lowland regions often have wild trees

### Cultivated Settings

- **Home gardens** in Pacific wet lowlands (around Golfito, Puerto Jiménez, Palmar Sur)
- **Caribbean lowlands** (Talamanca, Limón) in small-scale agroforestry
- **San Carlos region (northern lowlands)**: Occasionally planted
- **Local fruit markets** during season (August-October): Ask for "anona colorada" or "soncoya"

### Botanical Collections

- **CATIE (Centro Agronómico Tropical de Investigación y Enseñanza)** (Turrialba): Likely present in tropical fruit collections (confirm before visiting)
- **Universidad de Costa Rica (Finca Experimental)**: May have specimens

<Callout type="tip" title="Finding Anona Colorada">
  The best way to experience *Annona purpurea* is to visit **local fruit
  markets** in the Osa Peninsula (Puerto Jiménez, Golfito) or Limón/Talamanca
  regions during the fruiting season (August-October). Ask vendors for "anona
  colorada"—they'll know it by the red flesh. Another option: seek out small
  fincas and ask farmers—many know where wild trees grow.

## Cultural Significance and Traditional Knowledge

### Indigenous and Local Knowledge

_Annona purpurea_ has been used by indigenous peoples of Central America for centuries, though specific traditional knowledge varies by region.

- **Food source**: Valuable wild fruit collected during fruiting season
- **Medicinal use**: Limited documented traditional medical use (primarily seeds as external parasite treatment—dangerous)
- **Fish poison**: Seeds traditionally used to stun fish in rivers (now generally illegal)
- **Name origins**: "Soncoya" is an indigenous Nahuatl-origin word still used in Mexico and parts of Central America

### In Costa Rican Culture

While not as culturally prominent as guanábana or common anona, _A. purpurea_ is appreciated by rural communities familiar with it:

- **Seasonal treat**: Eaten fresh when encountered during fruiting season
- **Local markets**: Commands premium prices due to scarcity and distinctive flavor
- **Home remedy**: Some preparation of fruit (not seeds) as nutritious food for convalescence (no documented medicinal properties beyond nutrition)

<Callout type="info">
  In Costa Rica, *Annona purpurea* is known primarily to rural farmers,
  foragers, and fruit enthusiasts rather than being a widely cultivated
  commercial crop. This obscurity makes it a delightful discovery for those who
  encounter it!

## Advanced Care Guidance

### Site Design and Planting

- Establish in warm, humid lowland or premontane sites with 6-8 m spacing for airflow and pollinator movement.
- Prioritize deep, organic-rich soils with reliable drainage; avoid compacted planting pits and prolonged standing water.
- Plant at rainy-season onset (May-June) and protect juvenile trunks from weed competition and browsing damage.

### Watering Program

- **Establishment (0-8 months):** Deep watering 2 times per week during dry intervals.
- **Juvenile phase (8-24 months):** Water every 7-10 days during strong dry-season heat.
- **Mature trees:** Maintain moderate moisture through flowering and fruit fill; avoid severe drought stress.

### Fertilization Schedule

- At planting, incorporate compost plus a low-dose starter blend (10-30-10) to support root development.
- Apply balanced fertilizer (15-15-15) at early and mid rainy season for stable canopy and fruit set.
- Add potassium-forward support (12-8-20) late rainy season to improve fruit quality and sugar-acid balance.

### Pruning and Structure

- Formatively prune in years 1-3 to maintain a strong central framework and manageable harvest height.
- Remove crossing, shaded, or diseased branches after major harvest windows.
- Keep canopy open enough for beetle pollinator activity and reduced fungal pressure.

### Pest and Disease Management

- Monitor for fruit flies, anthracnose, and scale insects during humid periods.
- Remove fallen or damaged fruit quickly to reduce reinfestation pressure.
- Combine sanitation pruning with mulch renewal and biological controls before chemical treatments.

### Companion Planting

- **Recommended companions:** Cacao, guaba species, poro, banana, and pollinator-attracting herbs.
- **Agroforestry role:** Mid-canopy fruit tree for diversified humid tropical systems with staggered harvests.
- **Avoid nearby:** Highly competitive shallow-rooted grasses and species requiring prolonged drought.

### Seasonal Care Calendar (Costa Rican Conditions)

- **Dry season (Dec-Apr):** Supplemental irrigation, mulch maintenance, and structural scouting.
- **Early rains (May-Jul):** Main planting window, fertilization, and formative pruning.
- **Peak rains (Aug-Oct):** Disease monitoring, drainage checks, and careful fruit sanitation.
- **Transition (Nov):** Light pruning, soil amendment, and planning for next flowering cycle.

### Growth Timeline and Harvest Notes

- Trees usually begin bearing in years 3-5 under warm, humid conditions.
- Productive canopies stabilize around years 6-8 with regular nutrition and light management.
- Harvest at full physiological maturity to maximize flavor while minimizing post-harvest breakdown.
