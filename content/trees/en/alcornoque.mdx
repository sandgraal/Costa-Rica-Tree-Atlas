toxicityDetails: "Alcornoque is non-toxic. The fruits, while not typically consumed by humans (mealy texture, not particularly palatable), are non-toxic and safely eaten by wildlife including tapirs, peccaries, agoutis, and birds. No toxicity documented."
skinContactDetails: "No skin irritation. Safe to handle bark, leaves, and fruits."
safetyNotes: "Completely safe tree suitable for large properties and reforestation projects. The tree grows large (25-35m) so it needs space. The wood is extremely hard and durable, making it valuable for construction. Safe for planting near homes if space allows for mature size. Wildlife magnet - the abundant fruits attract many species."
wildlifeRisks: "Completely safe and highly beneficial for all wildlife. The fruits are a critical food source for large mammals (tapirs, peccaries) and many bird species. Safe for domestic animals though they typically don't eat the fruits."

# Alcornoque

<Callout type="success" title="The Wildlife Pantry Tree">
  The **Alcornoque** (_Licania arborea_) is one of Costa Rica's most important
  wildlife food trees. Its abundant fruits attract tapirs, peccaries, agoutis,
  and large birds, making it a keystone species in forest ecosystems. The
  extremely hard, durable wood has been used for centuries in heavy
  construction.

<AccordionItem title="🔬 Taxonomic Notes">

The genus _Licania_ contains over 200 species in tropical America. Chrysobalanaceae is sometimes called the "cocoplum family" and includes many species with edible or wildlife-important fruits. Several _Licania_ species occur in Costa Rica.

**Name Origin**: "Alcornoque" comes from Spanish for cork oak, though this tree is unrelated—the name refers to the bark texture.

<Callout type="success" title="The Wildlife Pantry">

_Licania arborea reminds us that a tree's value extends far beyond its timber.
As a keystone species, the Alcornoque feeds tapirs, peccaries, agoutis, and
countless other creatures. When you see an Alcornoque, you're seeing a
community pantry that has sustained forest wildlife for millennia. Its
incredibly hard wood is a bonus—the true treasure is the ecological network
it supports._
