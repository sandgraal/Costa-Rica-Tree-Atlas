toxicParts: []
skinContactRisk: "none"
allergenRisk: "low"
structuralRisks: []
childSafe: true
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "Acca sellowiana is completely non-toxic. All parts of the plant that are commonly consumed — the fruit and the flower petals — are safe for ingestion. The fruit is eaten fresh, in jams, juices, and desserts worldwide. The fleshy flower petals have a sweet, aromatic flavor and are consumed as edible garnishes. Leaves are used in traditional herbal teas in South America without reported adverse effects. No toxic compounds have been identified in any part of the plant."
skinContactDetails: "No skin contact risk. The leaves have a smooth upper surface and slightly fuzzy underside but cause no irritation. The fruit skin is slightly rough but non-irritating. The plant contains no latex, sap irritants, or dermatitis-causing compounds. Safe to handle without protective equipment."
allergenDetails: "Low allergen risk. Feijoa pollen is primarily entomophilous (insect-dispersed), particularly by birds that consume the edible petals. Minimal airborne pollen production reduces inhalation allergy risk. Rare cases of oral allergy syndrome have been reported in individuals with birch pollen allergies due to cross-reactive proteins, but this is uncommon. Fruit allergy is extremely rare."
structuralRiskDetails: ""
safetyNotes: "The Guayaba Chilena is an exceptionally safe plant for all settings including homes with children and pets. The fruit and flower petals are both edible. There are no thorns, toxic compounds, or structural hazards. It is one of the safest fruit-producing trees available for residential gardens in Costa Rica's highlands. The only consideration is that fallen ripe fruit can attract insects if not collected promptly."
wildlifeRisks: "Non-toxic to all wildlife. Fruit is consumed by birds and small mammals. In its native range, flowers are pollinated by birds that eat the fleshy petals — a mutualistically beneficial relationship. No toxicity concerns for domestic animals of any kind."

## Overview

_Acca sellowiana_, commonly known as Feijoa, Pineapple Guava, or Guayaba Chilena in Costa Rica, is an evergreen shrub or small tree from the Myrtaceae family — the same family as eucalyptus, guava, and cloves. Native to the highlands of southern Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, and northern Argentina, this species thrives in subtropical and temperate climates with cool nights and moderate temperatures.

In Costa Rica, the Guayaba Chilena is cultivated primarily in the Central Valley highlands and the Chirripó foothills at elevations above 1,200 meters, where conditions approximate its native subtropical habitat. The cool nights and seasonal dryness of the Central Valley provide the chilling hours and Mediterranean-like conditions that the Feijoa requires for optimal fruit production. It is found in home gardens in Cartago, the upper reaches of the Central Valley around San José, and increasingly in Heredia and Alajuela at higher elevations.

The fruit is extraordinary: a green, egg-shaped berry (3-8 cm) with a granular, jelly-like interior that tastes like a complex fusion of pineapple, guava, strawberry, and mint, combined with a floral, almost perfume-like aroma. The unique flavor profile has made Feijoa a prized fruit in New Zealand (where it is a major crop), Colombia, and increasingly in boutique markets worldwide. The flavor is difficult to describe to anyone who has not tasted it — a singular fruit experience.

Beyond the fruit, the flowers are themselves a culinary delight. The four fleshy petals are white on the outside and crimson-purple on the inside, with a sweet, spicy flavor reminiscent of cinnamon and marshmallow. They can be eaten fresh as garnishes, added to salads, or used to decorate desserts. Birds that visit the flowers eat the petals, pollinating the flower in the process — one of the few examples of petal-eating pollination (technically called petalopetalophagy) in the plant kingdom.

The Guayaba Chilena is also an attractive ornamental, with its silvery-green foliage, showy red-and-white flowers, and compact growth habit making it suitable for hedges, container gardening, and small garden spaces in the Costa Rican highlands.

### Taxonomic Notes

_Acca sellowiana_ was formerly classified as _Feijoa sellowiana_, and the genus name Feijoa persists as a common name worldwide. The species was named in honor of Friedrich Sellow (1789–1831), a German naturalist who collected extensively in southern Brazil. The genus _Acca_ was separated from _Feijoa_ based on morphological and molecular evidence, and is currently monotypic — _A. sellowiana_ is its only species. The species belongs to the subtribe Myrtinae within the diverse Myrtaceae family, closely related to guava (_Psidium_), Eugenia, and other berry-producing myrtles.

---

## Physical Description

### Growth Form

The Guayaba Chilena grows as a dense, multi-stemmed evergreen shrub or small tree. In its natural state, it develops a rounded, bushy form that can reach 3–7 meters in height and 3–5 meters in spread. It can be trained as a single-trunk small tree for garden settings or maintained as a compact hedge with regular pruning. The dense branching and evergreen foliage make it an excellent screening plant.

### Bark and Branches

The bark is smooth and pale gray on young branches, becoming slightly rough and flaky with age on the main stems. The branches are opposite, slightly pendulous on mature specimens, and covered with fine hairs when young. The wood is dense and hard but brittle — the small size of the tree makes it unsuitable for timber.

### Leaves

The leaves are opposite, simple, oval to elliptic, 3–7 cm long and 2–4 cm wide. They are thick and leathery, with a distinctive coloration: dark green and slightly glossy above, silvery-white and densely felted (tomentose) below with fine hairs. This two-toned appearance gives the foliage an attractive silvery sheen when the wind turns the leaves, similar to olive trees. Leaves are aromatic when crushed, with a eucalyptus-like scent from essential oils.

### Flowers

The flowers are spectacular and unique. They appear singly or in small clusters in the leaf axils, with 4 fleshy, waxy petals that are white or pale pink on the outside and vivid crimson-red on the inside. A prominent brush of 30-40 long, erect crimson stamens extends beyond the petals, giving the flower a striking firework-like appearance. Individual flowers are 2–3 cm across and last about a week. The fleshy petals are edible with a sweet, spicy flavor — birds eat them while visiting, incidentally pollinating the flowers.

### Fruit and Seeds

The fruit is a berry, oval to egg-shaped, 3–8 cm long and 3–5 cm in diameter, with a waxy, dark green skin that remains green even when ripe. The skin may develop a slight blush or roughening when mature. The interior consists of a clear, jelly-like, translucent pulp surrounding the seeds in the center, surrounded by a firmer, granular, white to cream-colored flesh near the skin. The flavor is complex and aromatic — combining elements of pineapple, guava, strawberry, and mint with floral undertones. Seeds are tiny, numerous, and edible. Ripe fruit detaches from the tree and falls — fruit is best picked up from the ground or caught just as it falls.

/>

The Guayaba Chilena is not native to Costa Rica but has been cultivated in the cooler highlands since the mid-20th century. It is most commonly found in:

- **Cartago highlands**: The cool valley around Cartago, Paraíso, and Tierra Blanca provides ideal conditions. Some of the most productive trees in the country grow here.
- **San José upper elevations**: Escazú hills, Santa Ana highlands, and Desamparados upper reaches.
- **Heredia**: San Rafael, San Isidro, and Barva at elevations above 1,400 m.
- **Alajuela**: Upper Central Valley around Grecia and Sarchí at elevations above 1,300 m.
- **Chirripó foothills**: Scattered plantings in the San Isidro de El General area at appropriate elevations.

The tree is not found in the Caribbean or Pacific lowlands — it cannot tolerate the year-round heat and humidity below about 1,000 meters elevation.

### Broader Distribution

_Acca sellowiana_ is native to southern Brazil (Paraná, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul), Uruguay, Paraguay, and northeastern Argentina (Misiones, Corrientes). It was introduced to southern France in 1890, and subsequently spread to California, Florida (limited success), New Zealand (now a major commercial crop), Australia, and throughout South America's highland regions. New Zealand and Colombia are the world's leading commercial producers.

### Ecological Role in Costa Rica

As an introduced species in Costa Rica, the Guayaba Chilena's ecological interactions are limited compared to native species, but it provides several ecosystem services in highland gardens:

- **Pollinator support**: Flowers attract hummingbirds, especially the Volcano Hummingbird (_Selasphorus flammula_) and the Scintillant Hummingbird (_Selasphorus scintilla_), which visit for nectar and consume petals
- **Bird food**: Ripe fruit is consumed by tanagers, thrushes (yigüirros), and other highland birds
- **Bee forage**: Flowers provide nectar and pollen for honeybees and native stingless bees (Meliponini)
- **Windbreak**: Dense foliage and compact form provide wind shelter in exposed highland gardens

### Pollination Biology

The Feijoa employs a fascinating and unusual pollination strategy. The fleshy petals serve as a reward for pollinating birds — primarily hummingbirds in the Americas while consuming the petals, birds brush against the long, erect stamens, picking up and depositing pollen. This "petal reward" system is relatively rare in the plant kingdom. In addition to bird pollination, bees also visit the flowers for nectar and pollen, contributing to pollination.

Most Feijoa cultivars are self-incompatible — they require cross-pollination from a genetically different variety to set fruit. This is an important consideration for growers in Costa Rica: planting at least two different varieties (or seedling trees with genetic variation) is essential for reliable fruit production.

---

## Uses and Applications

### Fresh Fruit

The Feijoa fruit is eaten fresh by cutting it in half and scooping out the flesh with a spoon — the skin is generally too tannic and gritty to eat comfortably, though some varieties have thinner, more palatable skin. The best fruit has a strong, perfume-like aroma, a translucent jelly center, and a balanced sweet-tart flavor.

- **Showy flowers**: Crimson-and-white flowers are highly decorative
- **Hedging**: Dense growth makes excellent formal or informal hedges
- **Container growing**: Adapts well to large pots for terraces and patios
- **Topiary**: Responds well to shaping and training

### Traditional Medicine

In its native range, the leaves and fruit of _Acca sellowiana_ are used in traditional medicine:

- **Leaves**: Infused as tea for digestive ailments, diarrhea, and inflammation
- **Fruit**: Consumed for vitamin C supplementation and general health
- **Essential oils**: Leaf extracts contain antimicrobial compounds (flavonoids, terpenes)
- **Modern research**: Studies have demonstrated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties of Feijoa extracts

## Cultural and Historical Significance

The Feijoa holds particular cultural importance in several countries. In New Zealand, where it was introduced in the early 20th century, it has become an iconic backyard fruit deeply embedded in the national food culture — "Feijoa season" is anticipated like apple or citrus season in other countries. New Zealand bakeries, cafés, and home kitchens produce feijoa muffins, chutneys, wines, and liqueurs during the autumn harvest.

In Colombia, the Feijoa is cultivated commercially in the highlands around Bogotá and Boyacá, and feijoa juice and yogurt are popular products. The fruit is associated with highland cuisine and cooler mountain climates.

In Costa Rica, the Guayaba Chilena is a relatively recent introduction but is gaining popularity among specialty fruit growers and home gardeners in the Central Valley highlands. Its association with European and New Zealand gardening traditions has made it a somewhat "gourmet" fruit, sometimes found at specialty farmers' markets (ferias) in Cartago and San José.

The species was first described scientifically from collections made by Friedrich Sellow during his extensive botanical explorations of southern Brazil in the 1820s. Sellow was one of the most prolific plant collectors in South American history, having documented thousands of species before his untimely death by drowning in 1831. The genus _Feijoa_ (now a synonym) was named in honor of João da Silva Feijó (1760–1824), a Portuguese-Brazilian naturalist, by Otto Karl Berg in 1859.

## Conservation Status

<Callout type="success" title="Least Concern">
  Acca sellowiana is classified as **Least Concern (LC)** by the IUCN. While
  wild populations in southern Brazil face habitat pressure from agricultural
  expansion and urbanization, the species is widely cultivated globally,
  ensuring its long-term survival. In Costa Rica, it has no conservation
  concerns as a cultivated species.
</Callout>

### Threats to Wild Populations

In its native range in southern Brazil, the Feijoa faces habitat loss due to:

- Conversion of Atlantic Forest remnants to agriculture (especially soybeans and cattle)
- Urbanization around cities in Paraná, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul
- Limited genetic diversity in some fragmented populations
- Climate change potentially disrupting the chilling requirements in warmer years

### Conservation Actions

- **In-situ**: Wild populations are protected in several reserves in southern Brazil, including Aparados da Serra National Park
- **Ex-situ**: Extensive germplasm collections exist in New Zealand, Australia, Colombia, and Brazil
- **Breeding programs**: Active cultivar development programs in New Zealand and Colombia have captured significant genetic diversity
- **Citizen conservation**: Backyard cultivation worldwide serves as a distributed ex-situ conservation strategy

## Growing the Guayaba Chilena in Costa Rica

### Site Selection

Choose a location in the Costa Rican highlands above 1,200 meters elevation with:

- **Full sun** (6+ hours daily)
- **Good air circulation** (helps prevent fungal diseases)
- **Well-drained soil** (the species does not tolerate waterlogging)
- **Protection from strong winds** (though the dense foliage is fairly wind-resistant)
- **Cool night temperatures** (essential for fruit quality and chilling requirement)

The Central Valley around Cartago, Heredia's upper reaches, and the Chirripó foothills are ideal locations.

### Propagation

**From Seed**: Seeds are extracted from ripe fruit and sown fresh in well-drained seedling mix. Germination takes 3-4 weeks. Seedlings are slow-growing and may take 3-5 years to fruit. Seedlings will not be true to the parent variety.

**From Cuttings**: Semi-hardwood cuttings taken in late summer root in 8-12 weeks with the application of rooting hormone. This method produces clones of the parent plant.

**Grafting**: The preferred method for named varieties. Whip-and-tongue or cleft grafts onto seedling rootstocks produce trees that fruit in 2-3 years with known fruit characteristics.

**Air Layering**: Effective on established branches; produces larger, faster-fruiting plants than cuttings.

### Planting and Care

- Plant in a hole twice the root ball width, enriched with compost
- Water deeply twice weekly during establishment (first year)
- Mulch heavily to conserve moisture and suppress weeds
- Apply balanced fertilizer (10-10-10) in March and September
- Prune after harvest to maintain shape and encourage new fruiting wood
- Thin excess fruit clusters if heavy set occurs
- Protect young trees from frost in exposed highlands above 2,000 m

### Cross-Pollination

**Important**: Plant at least 2 different seedling trees or named varieties for reliable fruit production. Most Feijoa cultivars are self-infertile and require cross-pollination. Space trees 3-5 meters apart for adequate cross-pollination while allowing room for growth.

/>

### Companion Planting

The Guayaba Chilena pairs well with other highland plants:

- **Beneficial companions**: Lavender, rosemary, marigolds (pest deterrent); coffee (shade complement at lower elevations); blueberries (similar soil preferences)
- **Compatible trees**: Avocado (at overlapping elevations), citrus (lemon, mandarin), granadilla (passionfruit)
- **Plants to avoid**: Heavy feeders that compete for nutrients; tall trees that shade out the Feijoa

---

## Orchard Monitoring and Productivity Tracking

Because Guayaba Chilena is often grown in small mixed orchards, standardized
records help stabilize fruit quality across years.

### Suggested annual indicators

- Flower-to-fruit set ratio by tree.
- Pollination success where two or more genotypes are present.
- Fruit size distribution and cracking incidence.
- Pest pressure trend (fruit fly, scale, fungal spots).
- Pruning response and next-season flowering intensity.

### Monitoring rhythm

- **Pre-flowering:** assess canopy balance and nutrient readiness.
- **Flowering window:** monitor pollinators and weather effects.
- **Fruit development:** track irrigation and thinning outcomes.
- **Post-harvest:** evaluate pruning effects and renewal strategy.

## Priority Actions for the Next 12 Months

1. Improve pollination reliability through companion planning.
2. Standardize fruit-quality sampling at harvest windows.
3. Recalibrate dry-season irrigation by canopy and soil response.
4. Reduce over-shading in mixed gardens with structural pruning.
5. Consolidate annual orchard notes into one decision register.

## Minimum Data Log Fields

For Guayaba Chilena orchards, include these fields in every annual record:

- Orchard block and tree ID.
- Elevation and microclimate note.
- Flowering intensity class.
- Fruit set and retained-fruit count.
- Pollinator activity observation.
- Irrigation interval and response.
- Pest/disease observation code.
- Linked photo and sampling reference.

## Where to See the Guayaba Chilena

### In Costa Rica

- **Cartago highlands**: Home gardens and small orchards around Tierra Blanca, Cot, and Pacayas
- **Lankester Botanical Garden** (Paraíso, Cartago): May have specimens in their tropical collection
- **Specialty nurseries**: Ask at nurseries in the Cartago and Heredia highlands
- **Farmers' markets**: During fruiting season (June-September), look for fruit at ferias in Cartago and San José

### Best Viewing Season

Visit during March–May for the spectacular flowers (crimson-and-white blossoms), or June–September for the fruiting season. The tree is attractive year-round thanks to its evergreen silvery-green foliage.
