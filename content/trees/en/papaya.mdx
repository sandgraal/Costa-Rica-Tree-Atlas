<Callout type="success" title="Year-Round Tropical Bounty">
  The **Papaya** (_Carica papaya_) is the quintessential tropical fruit tree,
  producing sweet, vitamin-rich fruits continuously throughout the year in Costa
  Rica's warm climate. Though originating from southern Mexico and Central
  America, it has spread worldwide and remains a cornerstone of Costa Rican
  nutrition and agriculture.

## Physical Description

### Overall Form

The Papaya is a fast-growing, short-lived tree with a single unbranched stem topped by a crown of large, deeply lobed leaves. The hollow trunk stores water and nutrients, and the tree produces fruits directly from the main stem, creating a distinctive appearance with fruits clustered just below the leaf crown.

## Interesting Facts

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="🧬 Three Sexes">

Papaya plants come in three sexual types: male, female, and hermaphrodite. Male
plants produce only pollen and no fruit. Female plants need a male nearby and
produce round fruits. Hermaphrodite plants are self-pollinating and produce the
most desirable pear-shaped fruits—farmers prefer these for commercial
production.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="⚡ Speed Champion">

Papaya is one of the fastest fruit-producing plants on Earth. From seed to
harvest typically takes only 9-14 months, and a single plant can produce 30-150
fruits per year. This rapid production cycle has made it invaluable for food
security in tropical regions.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🥩 Nature's Tenderizer">

The enzyme papain in papaya latex is so effective at breaking down proteins that
it's been used as a meat tenderizer for centuries. Central American indigenous
peoples wrapped meat in papaya leaves overnight to soften tough cuts—a practice
still used today.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🌍 Global Traveler">

From its origins in Central America, papaya has spread to virtually every
tropical region on Earth. It reached the Philippines via Spanish galleons in the
16th century, then spread throughout Asia. Today, India, Brazil, and Indonesia
are the largest producers.
