toxicityDetails: "No toxicity is documented for leaves, bark, flowers, or seeds under normal incidental exposure. The living tree is considered safe in gardens and public spaces."
skinContactDetails: "Contact with fresh leaves and bark is generally low risk. Sensitive individuals may develop mild irritation after prolonged handling of fresh sawdust or bark fragments."
allergenDetails: "As with other Cedrela species, wood dust can irritate eyes, skin, and airways during sawing or sanding. Use respirators and dust extraction in workshops."
structuralRiskDetails: "No unusual structural hazards are associated with this species beyond normal branch failure during severe storms."
safetyNotes: "Appropriate for school and community plantings. Main precautions apply to wood processing, not to casual contact with the standing tree."
wildlifeRisks: "No major wildlife poisoning concerns reported from foliage or fruit; flowers and canopy structure support montane biodiversity."

## Physical & Botanical Description

**General habit**:

- Medium to large deciduous tree, typically **25-40 m** in mature forest sites.
- Straight cylindrical bole can exceed **80 cm DBH**, with exceptional trees
  reported much larger.
- Crown is relatively open, with branching concentrated in upper sections.

**Bark and wood**:

- Outer bark gray-brown, sometimes exfoliating in thin irregular plates.
- Inner bark pale, aromatic when cut, characteristic of many Cedrela woods.
- Heartwood is durable for interior joinery and fine carpentry when properly
  seasoned.

**Leaves**:

- Pinnately compound leaves, usually **20-50 cm** long.
- Leaves carry multiple opposite to sub-opposite leaflets with glaucous lower
  surfaces.
- Deciduous behavior is pronounced in drier months at some sites.

**Flowers and fruit**:

- Small insect-pollinated flowers typically appear **April-May**.
- Woody capsules develop and ripen in early wet season, often **June-July**.
- Capsules split open to release winged seeds adapted for wind dispersal.

## Geographic Distribution

Cedro Dulce occurs from **southern Mexico (Chiapas)** through Central America
into **Panama**, with Costa Rica representing an important part of its montane
range.

### Distribution in Costa Rica

- **Cordillera Central**: mid-to-upper elevation moist forest zones.
- **Cordillera de Talamanca**: montane and premontane transitions.
- **Cordillera de Guanacaste** (reported): cloud forest edges and highland
  slopes.

## Habitat & Ecology

Cedro Dulce is associated with **montane humid forest systems**, often on steep
or dissected terrain where deep-rooting timber trees stabilize slopes and
contribute to canopy structure.

</PropertiesGrid>

### Ecological value

- Provides canopy complexity in highland forests.
- Supports insect communities via flowering events.
- Contributes leaf litter and nutrient cycling in mixed montane stands.
- Useful in restoration where native high-elevation timber structure is desired.

---

## Uses & Applications

### Timber and woodworking

Cedro Dulce wood is valued for its workability and aromatic character. It is
used for:

- Interior carpentry and cabinetry
- Furniture components
- Paneling and joinery
- Light structural members in appropriate dry-use contexts

### Agroforestry and restoration

- Shade and wind moderation in diversified farm mosaics
- Native-species enrichment planting in upper watersheds
- Long-term timber value in community forestry systems

### Local context

The name "cedro dulce" is used regionally for highland Cedrela timber that is
considered easier to work than some denser tropical hardwoods.

---

## Conservation Status

**IUCN Red List:** Least Concern (2019 assessment), with ongoing need for local
management where logging pressure and habitat conversion reduce mature trees.

**Trade framework:** Included under **CITES Appendix II** as part of Cedrela
spp. in the Neotropics, requiring traceability for international trade.

### Main pressures

- Selective harvest of straight, mature boles
- Habitat conversion in montane landscapes
- Regeneration bottlenecks where seed trees become sparse

### Conservation actions that help

- Protect seed trees in managed forests
- Use native-source planting material for restoration
- Maintain mixed-species stands to reduce pest pressure

---

## Growing Cedro Dulce

### Propagation

- Collect mature capsules at dehiscence onset.
- Dry and extract winged seeds carefully.
- Sow in light, well-drained substrate; maintain moisture without saturation.
- Transplant seedlings once root systems are well developed.

### Site recommendations

- Plant at rainy-season onset in highland zones.
- Choose full sun to light edge conditions.
- Keep strong drainage; avoid compacted valley bottoms with standing water.

### Management timeline

1. **Years 1-2**: weed control, dry-season support watering, stem protection.
2. **Years 3-5**: formative pruning to favor a straight leader.
3. **Years 6+**: low-maintenance growth phase with periodic health checks.

### Common cultivation constraints

- Shoot borer can damage leaders in young trees.
- Growth slows in nutrient-poor exposed ridges.
- Seed viability declines quickly without proper storage.

## Where to See Cedro Dulce in Costa Rica

Potential observation zones include montane protected areas and buffer forests:

- **Braulio Carrillo National Park** (Caribbean montane sectors)
- **Tapantí - Macizo de la Muerte National Park**
- **Los Quetzales National Park / Dota highlands**
