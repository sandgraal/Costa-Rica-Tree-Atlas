The name "cedro dulce" is used regionally for highland Cedrela timber that is
considered easier to work than some denser tropical hardwoods.

---

## Conservation Status

**IUCN Red List:** Least Concern (2019 assessment), with ongoing need for local
management where logging pressure and habitat conversion reduce mature trees.

**Trade framework:** Included under **CITES Appendix II** as part of Cedrela
spp. in the Neotropics, requiring traceability for international trade.

### Main pressures

- Selective harvest of straight, mature boles
- Habitat conversion in montane landscapes
- Regeneration bottlenecks where seed trees become sparse

### Conservation actions that help

- Protect seed trees in managed forests
- Use native-source planting material for restoration
- Maintain mixed-species stands to reduce pest pressure

---

## Growing Cedro Dulce

### Propagation

- Collect mature capsules at dehiscence onset.
- Dry and extract winged seeds carefully.
- Sow in light, well-drained substrate; maintain moisture without saturation.
- Transplant seedlings once root systems are well developed.

### Site recommendations

- Plant at rainy-season onset in highland zones.
- Choose full sun to light edge conditions.
- Keep strong drainage; avoid compacted valley bottoms with standing water.

### Management timeline

1. **Years 1-2**: weed control, dry-season support watering, stem protection.
2. **Years 3-5**: formative pruning to favor a straight leader.
3. **Years 6+**: low-maintenance growth phase with periodic health checks.

### Common cultivation constraints

- Shoot borer can damage leaders in young trees.
- Growth slows in nutrient-poor exposed ridges.
- Seed viability declines quickly without proper storage.

| October   | Drainage checks on steep or compacted sites.                          | Audit stock quality and update propagation protocols.         |
| November  | Transition-season risk review before dry months.                      | Prioritize seedlings with strong root architecture.           |
| December  | Reinforce mulch, browse protection, and irrigation plans.             | Finalize annual nursery and provenance report.                |

---

## Seed Supply and Nursery Quality Control

For Cedrela species, nursery consistency strongly determines field performance.

### Seed handling protocol

- Collect capsules from multiple mature trees per landscape unit.
- Separate seed lots by elevation band and mother-tree location.
- Dry only until extraction is feasible; avoid prolonged warm storage.
- Label every batch with date, source stand, and collector initials.

### Nursery quality checkpoints

- Reject seedlings with root spiraling, split stems, or weak apical dominance.
- Maintain moderate shade in early stages, then progressive hardening.
- Keep irrigation uniform to prevent extreme growth variation within a lot.
- Track emergence percentage and early mortality by seed lot.

### Outplanting readiness criteria

- Root system occupies container volume without circling.
- Stem is straight and resilient, with healthy terminal bud.
- Leaf color indicates balanced nutrition without excess soft growth.
- Plant is hardened for full-sun transition at field site.

## Similar Species and Common Confusions

Cedro Dulce can be confused with other Cedrela species or fast-growing
highland timber trees when sterile.

| Potential confusion              | How confusion happens                               | Fast field discriminator                                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cedro amargo (_Cedrela odorata_) | Shared leaf architecture in juvenile stages.        | Cedro Dulce is more associated with cooler montane contexts and narrower local distribution. |
| Laurel species (_Cordia_ spp.)   | Similar plantation context and timber purpose.      | Laurel foliage texture and venation differ clearly from Cedrela compound leaves.             |
| Young cristóbal trees            | Similar stand structure in mixed restoration plots. | Cedro Dulce has distinct capsule fruit and different bark aging pattern.                     |

### Diagnostic note

When flowers or fruits are absent, combine leaf architecture, bark texture, and
site elevation rather than relying on a single trait.

---

## Field Identification Checklist

Use this checklist during monitoring visits to reduce misidentification and
improve data quality in restoration records.

- Confirm montane context and drainage conditions.
- Verify compound leaf structure and leaflet arrangement.
- Check bark tone and fissuring pattern by age class.
- Record any reproductive material (buds, flowers, capsules).
- Photograph canopy profile plus bark close-up for archive.
- Compare with at least one nearby potential look-alike.
- Log observer confidence (high, medium, low).

### Minimum photo set for monitoring teams

1. Whole-tree profile including canopy.
2. Trunk and bark at chest height.
3. Leaf detail against neutral background.
4. Reproductive structures if present.

---

## Restoration Deployment Model

Cedro Dulce is most effective as a long-horizon structural and timber component
within mixed native restoration.

### Recommended deployment patterns

- **Watershed enrichment strips:** Integrate along upper-catchment forest edges.
- **Mixed timber clusters:** Combine with native species of contrasting growth form.
- **Community forest modules:** Use for long-cycle value with clear stewardship plans.

### Monitoring indicators

- Year-1 and year-2 survival rate by seed lot.
- Stem straightness class at years 2, 4, and 6.
- Canopy closure contribution in mixed stands.
- Presence of pest damage on apical leaders.

### Adaptive management triggers

- Survival below threshold triggers replanting and site diagnosis.
- Recurrent leader damage triggers protective interventions.
- Persistent nutrient stress triggers soil and mulch strategy revision.

---

## Timber Traceability and Harvest Governance

Because Cedrela trade is regulated, restoration and plantation programs should
be traceability-ready from establishment stage.

### Governance practices that reduce risk

- Keep provenance and planting records at plot level.
- Tag production trees early for long-term trace chains.
- Document thinning and pruning events with date and purpose.
- Align inventory formats with legal transport documentation needs.

### Pre-harvest integrity checks

- Verify species identity before any harvest planning.
- Reconcile plot inventory with mapped stem counts.
- Confirm compliance with current national and CITES-linked requirements.
