# Mango (King of Fruits)

<Callout type="success" title="The King of Tropical Fruits">
  The **Mango** (_Mangifera indica_) is undoubtedly the **King of Fruits**—
  cultivated for over 4,000 years and beloved by billions worldwide. Though
  native to South Asia, this magnificent tree has become completely naturalized
  in Costa Rica, where it lines roads, fills backyards, and dominates fruit
  markets during its glorious season. From the first green mangoes of the season
  eaten with salt and chili to the perfectly ripe, honey-sweet fruits of peak
  harvest, the Mango is woven into the fabric of tropical life. No tree better
  symbolizes the abundance and generosity of the tropics.

## Physical Description

### Overall Form

The Mango is a large, long-lived evergreen tree with a dense, rounded crown. Mature trees are impressive—broad-canopied, heavily branched, and often dominant in the landscape. The tree can live for over 100 years, with some specimens producing fruit for centuries. Young growth is often bronze or reddish, creating seasonal color contrasts.

## Cultivation

### Growing Mangoes

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Site Selection">
    **Ideal Conditions**: - Full sun (essential) - Protected from strong winds -
    Well-drained soil - Low elevation (below 600m) - Distinct dry season
    (promotes flowering) **Avoid**: - Waterlogged sites - Heavy shade -
    Frost-prone areas - Very high rainfall (reduces flowering)
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Propagation">
    **From Seed**: - Polyembryonic seeds produce true-to-type - Monoembryonic
    seeds variable - 5-8 years to fruit - Large, vigorous trees **Grafting**
    (preferred commercial): - Ensures variety characteristics - Fruit in 3-4
    years - Smaller, manageable trees - Air layering also used
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Care and Harvest">
    **Maintenance**: - Prune after harvest to maintain size - Fertilize 2-3
    times per year - Irrigation critical during flowering - Pest management for
    fruit flies **Harvest**: - Pick when mature (shoulder development) - Handle
    carefully (bruises easily) - Ripen at room temperature - Commercial: picked
    green, ripened later

## Cautions

### Mango and Allergies

<Callout type="warning" title="Mango Sensitivity">
  Important to know about mango: **Related to Poison Ivy**: Mango belongs to
  Anacardiaceae—same family as poison ivy! The sap contains urushiol-like
  compounds. **Contact Dermatitis**: - Sap can cause skin irritation - Worse
  around mouth ("mango mouth") - Affects some people, not all - Usually from
  unpeeled fruit **Prevention**: - Have someone else peel mangoes - Don't let
  skin touch mouth area - Wash hands after handling - Sensitivity often develops
  over time If you've never had a reaction, you're probably fine—but be aware!

<Callout type="success" title="The King Holds Court">
  There's a reason the mango is called the King of Fruits. No other tree so
  perfectly embodies tropical abundance—those dense, spreading crowns providing
  shade from the fierce sun, the explosion of fragrant flowers that fill the air
  in dry season, and then the glorious harvest of fruits in every shade from
  green to gold to red. Whether you're eating a perfectly ripe mango over the
  kitchen sink (the only civilized way to handle the juicy mess), or buying a
  bag of green mangoes to eat with salt and chili, you're participating in a
  4,000-year tradition of human appreciation for this magnificent fruit. In
  Costa Rica, where mangoes have become as integral to the landscape as any
  native tree, the mango season is a time of abundance, sharing, and simple joy.
  Long live the King!
