# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "low"
toxicParts:
  - "sap"
  - "leaves"
skinContactRisk: "moderate"
allergenRisk: "moderate"
structuralRisks: []
childSafe: true
petSafe: false
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "The fruit is safe to eat and highly nutritious. However, leaves and unripe fruit contain urushiol-like compounds similar to poison ivy (same family Anacardiaceae). The sap can cause mild gastrointestinal upset if ingested in quantity. Dogs and cats should not eat mango leaves as they can cause digestive issues. The ripe fruit flesh is safe for humans."
skinContactDetails: "Mango sap contains urushiol-like compounds that can cause contact dermatitis in sensitive individuals - the same irritant found in poison ivy. This typically manifests as 'mango mouth' - redness, itching, or small blisters around the lips and mouth after eating unpeeled mango. Reactions vary widely: some people never experience it, while others develop sensitivity over time. The peel contains higher concentrations than the flesh. Hand-to-mouth contact after handling sap or peel is the most common route. Reactions are typically mild to moderate and resolve in a few days."
allergenDetails: "People with poison ivy/poison oak sensitivity may be at higher risk for mango dermatitis. The allergen is primarily in the peel and sap, not the flesh. Some individuals develop oral allergy syndrome. Wood dust from mango lumber can cause respiratory irritation in woodworkers."
safetyNotes: "FRUIT IS SAFE TO EAT. To avoid skin reactions: peel mangoes with gloves if sensitive, wash hands thoroughly after handling, avoid contact between peel and face/lips, or have someone else peel them for you. Most people can eat peeled mango without issues. The fruit is enjoyed by billions worldwide. Sensitivity often develops gradually with repeated exposure. Children can safely eat peeled mango. Keep pets from eating leaves or unripe fruit. If you've eaten mangoes without reactions, you're likely fine - just be aware of the potential."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "moderate"
growthRateDetails: "2-3 ft/year once established; grafted trees fruit in 3-5 years, seed-grown trees in 5-8 years"
matureSize: "15-30 m tall (50-100 ft), crown spread 10-15 m; size depends on variety and pruning"
hardiness: "Tropical and subtropical 0-1500m; performs best below 600m; sensitive to frost"
soilRequirements: "Well-drained soils essential - intolerant of waterlogging; pH 5.5-7.5; tolerates sandy, loamy, or clay soils if drainage good"
waterNeeds: "moderate"
waterDetails: "Moderate water needs. Deep watering during flowering and fruit development (Dec-May). Reduce water 2-3 months before flowering to stress tree and trigger bloom. Once established (3+ years), tolerates dry season on rainfall alone. Young trees need weekly watering during dry periods."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plant 8-12 m apart for home gardens; 10-15 m for large shade trees; keep 8+ m from buildings"
propagationMethods:
  - "grafting"
  - "seeds"
  - "air layering"
propagationDifficulty: "moderate"
plantingSeason: "Best planted start of rainy season (May-June); container trees can be planted year-round with irrigation"
maintenanceNeeds: "REGULAR PRUNING ESSENTIAL for fruit production. Years 1-3: train to open center structure, remove crossing branches. Mature trees: prune after harvest to manage size, improve air circulation, remove diseased wood. Height management critical - keep under 5-6 m for easy harvest. Fertilize 3-4 times per year (nitrogen-rich during growth, low-nitrogen before flowering). Monitor for anthracnose during wet season. Wear gloves when pruning to avoid urushiol irritation from sap."
commonProblems:
  - "Anthracnose (fungal disease) - black spots on leaves, flowers, fruit; especially in wet weather; spray copper fungicide"
  - "Mango weevil - larvae tunnel in fruit; maintain sanitation, remove fallen fruit"
  - "Fruit flies - puncture fruit to lay eggs; use traps and bag developing fruit"
  - "Powdery mildew on flowers - sulfur dust or fungicide spray"
  - "Alternate bearing - heavy crop one year, light the next; manage with pruning and fertilization"
  - "Sooty mold from aphids/mealybugs - spray with horticultural oil or soap"
  - "Squirrels, bats, parrots eating fruit - net trees or harvest early"
  - "Sunburn on fruit during extreme heat - leave some foliage for shade"

# Mango (King of Fruits)

<Callout type="success" title="The King of Tropical Fruits">
  The **Mango** (_Mangifera indica_) is undoubtedly the **King of Fruits**—
  cultivated for over 4,000 years and beloved by billions worldwide. Though
  native to South Asia, this magnificent tree has become completely naturalized
  in Costa Rica, where it lines roads, fills backyards, and dominates fruit
  markets during its glorious season. From the first green mangoes of the season
  eaten with salt and chili to the perfectly ripe, honey-sweet fruits of peak
  harvest, the Mango is woven into the fabric of tropical life. No tree better
  symbolizes the abundance and generosity of the tropics.

## Cultivation

### Growing Mangoes

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Site Selection">
    **Ideal Conditions**: - Full sun (essential) - Protected from strong winds -
    Well-drained soil - Low elevation (below 600m) - Distinct dry season
    (promotes flowering) **Avoid**: - Waterlogged sites - Heavy shade -
    Frost-prone areas - Very high rainfall (reduces flowering)
  </AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Propagation">
  **From Seed**: - Polyembryonic seeds produce true-to-type - Monoembryonic
  seeds variable - 5-8 years to fruit - Large, vigorous trees **Grafting**
  (preferred commercial): - Ensures variety characteristics - Fruit in 3-4 years
  - Smaller, manageable trees - Air layering also used
</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Care and Harvest">
  **Maintenance**: - Prune after harvest to maintain size - Fertilize 2-3 times
  per year - Irrigation critical during flowering - Pest management for fruit
  flies **Harvest**: - Pick when mature (shoulder development) - Handle
  carefully (bruises easily) - Ripen at room temperature - Commercial: picked
  green, ripened later
</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Companion Planting">
    **Beneficial Companions**:
    - **Leguminous cover crops (Mucuna, Desmodium)**: Fix nitrogen, suppress weeds, improve soil fertility
    - **Turmeric & ginger**: Groundcover that retains moisture and provides secondary income
    - **Lemongrass & citronella**: Natural pest repellents help deter fruit flies and other insects
    - **Marigolds (_Tagetes_)**: Attract beneficial insects, repel some pests
    - **Pigeon peas**: Nitrogen fixation, windbreak for young trees, edible crop
    - **Sweet potato**: Living mulch, prevents erosion on slopes

    **Compatible Fruit Trees** (maintain 10-15m spacing):
    - Citrus (oranges, limes) - similar water needs, lower stature
    - Avocado - complementary harvest seasons
    - Sapote (_Pouteria sapota_) - similar cultural requirements
    - Mamey - compatible growth habits
    - Coconut palms - provide light filtered shade when young

    **Plants to Avoid**:
    - Other large canopy trees within 15m (competition for light, water, nutrients)
    - Water-demanding vegetables directly under canopy (mango monopolizes water)
    - Shallow-rooted crops near trunk (roots extend far beyond canopy)
    - Heavy shade-producing plants that reduce flowering

    **Agroforestry Integration**:
    - Excellent as scattered overstory tree in pasture systems
    - Compatible with shade-tolerant crops (cacao, vanilla) when young
    - Works well in home orchard polyculture with adequate spacing
    - Traditional "mango + citrus + livestock" systems common in Guanacaste
    - Living fence integration (plant 10-15m apart along property lines)
    - Suitable for silvopastoral systems (cattle can graze under mature trees)

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Seasonal Care Calendar">
    **December-February (Dry Season - Flowering Period)**:
    - **CRITICAL**: Reduce or stop watering 8-12 weeks before expected flowering (November) to stress tree and trigger bloom
    - Monitor flower panicle development (usually December-January)
    - Apply pre-flowering fertilizer in November (low nitrogen, high phosphorus: 5-30-15)
    - Begin irrigation once flowers open to support fruit set
    - Hand-pollinate if bee activity is low
    - Scout for and control powdery mildew on flowers (sulfur dust if needed)
    - Monitor for anthracnose on developing panicles

    **March-April (Early Rainy Season - Fruit Development)**:
    - Peak fruit development period
    - Maintain consistent watering (critical for fruit sizing)
    - Apply balanced fertilizer (15-15-15) in March
    - Thin fruit clusters if excessive (improves fruit size and reduces alternate bearing)
    - Install fruit fly traps (methyl eugenol or protein baits)
    - Bag developing fruits for premium quality (paper bags prevent fruit flies and sunburn)
    - Watch for fruit drop (normal; tree self-thins)

    **May-August (Rainy Season - Harvest & Post-Harvest)**:
    - Main harvest period (May-July depending on variety)
    - Harvest when fruit develops "shoulders" and skin color lightens
    - Pick fruit before fully ripe (will ripen in 3-7 days at room temperature)
    - **Post-harvest pruning** (August): Remove diseased wood, thin canopy, manage height
    - Reduce or stop fertilization during heavy rains (leaching risk)
    - Monitor for anthracnose on fruit and leaves (copper fungicide if severe)
    - Collect and destroy fallen fruit to reduce pest populations
    - Apply final annual fertilizer in late August (after pruning)

    **September-November (Late Rainy/Transition - Vegetative Growth)**:
    - Trees put on vegetative growth
    - Reduce watering in preparation for dry season flowering stress
    - No fertilization (encourages vegetative growth over flower formation)
    - Clean up fallen leaves and fruit (sanitation reduces pests/diseases)
    - Scout for and treat any scale, mealybug, or sooty mold issues
    - November: Begin withholding water to induce flowering stress

## Cautions

### Mango and Allergies

<Callout type="warning" title="Mango Sensitivity">
  Important to know about mango: **Related to Poison Ivy**: Mango belongs to
  Anacardiaceae—same family as poison ivy! The sap contains urushiol-like
  compounds. **Contact Dermatitis**: - Sap can cause skin irritation - Worse
  around mouth ("mango mouth") - Affects some people, not all - Usually from
  unpeeled fruit **Prevention**: - Have someone else peel mangoes - Don't let
  skin touch mouth area - Wash hands after handling - Sensitivity often develops
  over time If you've never had a reaction, you're probably fine—but be aware!

<Callout type="success" title="The King Holds Court">
  There's a reason the mango is called the King of Fruits. No other tree so
  perfectly embodies tropical abundance—those dense, spreading crowns providing
  shade from the fierce sun, the explosion of fragrant flowers that fill the air
  in dry season, and then the glorious harvest of fruits in every shade from
  green to gold to red. Whether you're eating a perfectly ripe mango over the
  kitchen sink (the only civilized way to handle the juicy mess), or buying a
  bag of green mangoes to eat with salt and chili, you're participating in a
  4,000-year tradition of human appreciation for this magnificent fruit. In
  Costa Rica, where mangoes have become as integral to the landscape as any
  native tree, the mango season is a time of abundance, sharing, and simple joy.
  Long live the King!
