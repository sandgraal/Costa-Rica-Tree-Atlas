# Guaba (Ice Cream Bean)

<Callout type="success" title="Nature's Sweet Gift to Agroforestry">
  The **Guaba** or **Ice Cream Bean** (_Inga edulis_) is a tropical treasure—a
  tree that gives generously in every way. Its long, twisted pods contain sweet,
  cotton-like pulp that children throughout Latin America have enjoyed for
  millennia. But the Guaba's gifts go far deeper: as a legume, it captures
  nitrogen from the air and deposits it in the soil, enriching farmland with
  every fallen leaf. This combination of delicious fruit and ecological service
  has made it one of the most important trees in tropical agroforestry,
  providing shade for coffee and cacao plantations while improving soil
  fertility for free. In Costa Rica, the Guaba is as common in backyards as in
  the forest, beloved by all ages.

## The Inga Genus

### One of Many Relatives

<Callout type="info" title="A Diverse Family">
  _Inga_ is a large genus with over **300 species** in the American tropics: -
  Many species produce edible fruit - All are nitrogen-fixers - Many used in
  agroforestry - Identification between species can be difficult In Costa Rica,
  several _Inga_ species are called "guaba" or "cuajiniquil." _Inga edulis_ is
  the most widely cultivated for its exceptional fruit.
</Callout>

## Ecological Importance

### The Nitrogen-Fixing Superpower

<FeatureBox title="Feeding the Soil" icon="🌱">
  Like other legumes, Guaba has a superpower: **nitrogen fixation**. **How It
  Works**: - Root nodules contain Rhizobium bacteria - Bacteria convert
  atmospheric N₂ to ammonia - Tree gets nitrogen; soil gets enriched - No
  synthetic fertilizer needed! **Contribution**: - Deposits 50-200 kg N/ha/year
  in leaf litter - Improves soil for surrounding crops - Reduces need for
  chemical fertilizers - Builds soil organic matter This is why Guaba is
  essential in agroforestry systems—it literally feeds the soil while providing
  shade and fruit!
</FeatureBox>

### Wildlife Value

</Column>
<Column>

#### Other Wildlife Services

- **Nectar for hummingbirds**: Flowers visited
- **Bee pasture**: Important nectar source
- **Nesting sites**: Broad branches
- **Shade habitat**: Understory conditions
- **Connectivity**: Wildlife corridors

## Uses and Applications

### The Delicious Fruit

<Callout type="success" title="A Beloved Treat">
  Throughout Latin America, Guaba pods are a favorite snack: **Traditional
  Consumption**: - Eaten fresh, directly from pod - Popular with children -
  Shared socially - Seasonal treat **Commercial Products** (limited): - Fresh
  pods sold at markets - Some artisanal products - Potential for more
  development **Nutritional Value**: - Good source of fiber - Contains vitamin C
  - Natural sugars for energy - Low calories The main "product" is simply fresh
  pods eaten out of hand!
</Callout>

### Agroforestry Champion

<FeatureBox title="The Perfect Shade Tree" icon="☕">
  Guaba is one of the most important trees in tropical agroforestry: **For
  Coffee Plantations**: - Provides dappled shade (coffee prefers some shade) -
  Fixes nitrogen (reduces fertilizer needs) - Deep roots don't compete with
  coffee - Fast-growing for quick establishment - Pruning provides
  mulch/firewood **For Cacao**: - Similar shade benefits - Traditional in cacao
  systems - Improves soil continuously **For General Farming**: - Living fence
  material - Improved fallow species - Alley cropping systems - Erosion control
  "Café bajo sombra de guaba" (coffee under guaba shade) is a model sustainable
  system practiced throughout Central America.

<Callout type="success" title="Nature's Complete Package">
  Few trees give as generously as the Guaba. There's the obvious gift— those
  long, twisted pods filled with sweet, cotton-like pulp that children across
  Latin America have enjoyed for thousands of years. But beneath the soil,
  invisible to us, the Guaba works its true magic: converting nitrogen from the
  air into a form that enriches the earth, making it one of nature's most
  effective soil improvers. This combination of delicious fruit and ecological
  service has made the Guaba indispensable in sustainable farming systems
  throughout the tropics. In Costa Rica, where the Guaba shades countless coffee
  plants while providing snacks for farmers' children, this remarkable tree
  demonstrates that human cultivation and ecological health can work hand in
  hand. Every pod of Guaba is a reminder that the best solutions are often the
  ones nature already provides.
