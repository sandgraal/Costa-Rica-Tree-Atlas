# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "none"
toxicParts: []
skinContactRisk: "low"
allergenRisk: "moderate"
structuralRisks: []
childSafe: true
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "The tree itself poses no toxicity hazard. Leaves, bark, flowers, and seeds are non-toxic to humans and animals. The tree is safe for planting in gardens, parks, and areas accessible to children and pets. The bark has traditional medicinal uses and no ingestion toxicity has been reported at normal doses."
skinContactDetails: "Direct contact with living plant parts (leaves, bark, flowers) is generally safe with minimal irritation risk. Some sensitive individuals may experience mild skin reactions from prolonged contact with fresh bark or sap. Overall skin contact risk for most people is very low."
allergenDetails: "Wood dust from Cedro Real is a MODERATE allergen for woodworkers and carpenters. Documented reactions include respiratory irritation, sneezing, coughing, and dermatitis. The aromatic oils in freshly cut wood can trigger respiratory symptoms in sensitive individuals. Always wear protective equipment (dust mask, gloves, eye protection) when cutting, sanding, or machining this wood. Ensure good ventilation in workshops. For most people encountering the living tree or finished wood products (furniture), allergen risk is minimal."
safetyNotes: "The LIVING TREE is completely safe for gardens, parks, and home landscapes - children and pets can play near it without concern. The primary safety consideration is for WOODWORKERS: wood dust is a respiratory sensitizer and skin irritant. Professional carpenters and furniture makers should use dust collection systems, wear N95 or P100 respirators, and protect skin when working with Cedro Real lumber. Finished wood products (furniture, musical instruments) pose no risk to end users."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "fast"
growthRateDetails: "Fast growth; can reach 3-4 meters within 2 years from seed in optimal conditions; growth of 1-2 m/year typical; reaches commercial timber size in 20-30 years"
matureSize: "25-50 m tall (typically 25-35m in Costa Rica), crown spread 15-20 m; trunk can reach 50-100 cm diameter above buttresses; may produce straight bole 12-18 m long"
hardiness: "Tropical moist to wet forests; 0-1500m elevation; prefers humid conditions; found in both primary and secondary forests on both slopes of Costa Rica"
soilRequirements: "Prefers deep, fertile, well-drained soils; grows best on alluvial or volcanic soils with good drainage; tolerates chalky soils; benefits from organic matter; pH 5.5-7.0"
waterNeeds: "moderate"
waterDetails: "Moderate water needs. Young trees need regular watering during establishment. Established trees tolerate seasonal drought but produce best with consistent moisture. Found naturally along streams and in upland rainforests."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plant 10-15 m from buildings for shade/ornamental use; 4-6 m spacing in timber plantations; needs full sun for optimal growth but tolerates moderate shade when young"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
propagationDifficulty: "easy"
plantingSeason: "Plant at start of rainy season (May-June) ideal; seeds germinate within 12-18 days with very high germination rate; seedlings ready to transplant in 2-4 months"
maintenanceNeeds: "MODERATE maintenance timber/shade tree. VULNERABLE species - plant for conservation. Years 1-3: regular watering during dry season, weed control important, protect from shoot borer (Hypsipyla grandella - affects Cedrela species). Years 4-10: prune to develop straight single trunk for timber, remove competing vegetation. Fertilization beneficial in poor soils. Mature trees: minimal care required. NOTE: Susceptible to mahogany shoot borer - plant in mixed stands with non-Meliaceae species to reduce attack."
commonProblems:
  - "SHOOT BORER (Hypsipyla grandella) - attacks terminal shoots in Cedrela species, damages timber form - plant mixed with other species to reduce damage"
  - "Over-exploitation has made wild populations vulnerable - conservation planting important"
  - "Wood rots rapidly when buried or submerged - not suitable for ground contact applications"
  - "Somewhat susceptible to termites despite aromatic wood"
  - "May show some collapse during drying if not handled carefully"
  - "Timber value can attract theft from plantations"

# Cedro Real

<Callout type="tip" title="The Royal Cedar">
  **Cedro Real** (_Cedrela fissilis_), also known as Argentine Cedar or Cedro
  Rosa, is one of the most valuable timber trees of the mahogany family in South
  and Central America. Its beautiful pinkish-brown wood with golden lustre has
  been prized for centuries for fine furniture, plywood, and even aircraft
  construction. Despite being a distinct species from the better-known Spanish
  Cedar (_C. odorata_), its wood is often sold together with it due to similar
  quality and appearance.

## Ecological Significance

### Forest Role

<Callout type="success" title="Pioneer to Secondary Forest Species">
  Cedro Real is a fast-growing species that thrives in both dense primary
  forests and more open secondary forest conditions. Its rapid growth rate—up to
  3-4 meters in height within 2 years from seed—makes it valuable for forest
  restoration and as a pioneer species in degraded areas. It is suitable for
  establishing woodland gardens and restoration plantings.
</Callout>

### Wildlife Interactions

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Pollinators

- **Insects**: Primary pollinators
- **Bees**: Visit small flowers
- **Moths**: Nocturnal pollination
- **Wind**: May assist pollen movement

#### Seed Dispersers

- **Wind**: Primary dispersal mechanism
- **Winged seeds**: Travel considerable distances
- **Gravity**: Seeds fall near parent tree

</Column>
<Column>

#### Pest Interactions

- **Shoot Borer**: _Hypsipyla grandella_ affects Cedrela
- **Moth larvae**: Bore into terminal shoots
- **Impact**: Causes forking, reduces timber value
- **Management**: Plant in mixed stands

#### Habitat Value

- **Cavity nesters**: Use older trees
- **Epiphytes**: Host orchids, bromeliads
- **Shade**: Provides canopy cover
- **Agroforestry**: Used in mixed plantings

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

<Callout type="warning" title="Shoot Borer Vulnerability">
  Like other _Cedrela_ species, Cedro Real is susceptible to the mahogany shoot
  borer (_Hypsipyla grandella_). This pest attacks terminal shoots, causing
  forking and dramatically reducing timber value. The species should NOT be
  planted in homogeneous stands; instead, mix with non-Meliaceae species to
  reduce attack intensity. This pest remains a major limitation for commercial
  plantations of Cedrela species throughout Latin America.

    { label: "Main Threats", value: "Overexploitation, habitat loss" },
  ]}
/>

### Conservation Concerns

<Callout type="warning" title="Endangered by Exploitation">
  Once a common lowland forest tree, Cedro Real has been **overexploited for
  timber** throughout its range and is now considered endangered in many areas.
  While a few populations remain stable, many have been:

- **Severely reduced** in size
- **Fragmented** into isolated patches
- **Locally extirpated** from former range areas

The wood is often sold in mixed batches with _Cedrela odorata_ (Spanish Cedar)
due to similar quality, making trade monitoring difficult. The species was
listed on CITES Appendix II in 2020 to regulate international trade.

<Callout type="tip" title="A Vulnerable Treasure">
  Cedro Real represents the challenges facing valuable timber species throughout
  the tropics. Centuries of selective logging have reduced populations to
  fragments of their former abundance. Today, CITES protection helps regulate
  trade, but the real conservation work happens on the ground—through protected
  areas, sustainable forestry practices, and restoration plantings that include
  this magnificent tree. By planting Cedro Real in mixed-species agroforestry
  systems and forest restoration projects, we can help ensure that future
  generations inherit both the genetic diversity and the ecological benefits of
  this species.
