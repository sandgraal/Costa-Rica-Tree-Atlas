# Pomarrosa (Rose Apple)

<Callout type="success" title="The Rose-Scented Fruit Tree">
  The **Pomarrosa** (_Syzygium jambos_), known in English as Rose Apple, is a
  beloved ornamental and fruit tree found throughout Costa Rica. Originally from
  Southeast Asia, this fragrant tree has naturalized so thoroughly that many
  consider it a local species. The yellow, rose-scented fruits are
  unmistakable—crisp, refreshing, and perfumed. For generations of Costa Ricans,
  the Pomarrosa represents summer afternoons and garden shade.

## The Rose Apple Fruit

### Characteristics

<DataTable
  headers={["Feature", "Description", "Notes"]}
  rows={[
    ["Texture", "Crisp, apple-like", "Best when fresh"],
    ["Flavor", "Mild, floral, rose-like", "Subtle sweetness"],
    ["Aroma", "Strong rose scent", "Very distinctive"],
    ["Seeds", "1-4 per fruit", "Loose in hollow center"],
    ["Skin", "Edible, thin", "Pale yellow"],
  ]}
/>

### How to Enjoy

<FeatureBox title="Eating Rose Apples" icon="🍎">
  **Fresh Consumption** (most common):
  1. Wash the fruit
  2. Bite directly (skin is edible)
  3. Work around the hollow center with seeds
  4. Discard seeds

**Tips**:

- Best served chilled
- Eat same day for crispest texture
- The fragrance is as important as flavor
- Try with lime juice and salt (Costa Rican style)

**Other Preparations**:

- Light jam/jelly (mild flavor)
- Fruit salads
- Stewed with sugar and spices
- Stuffed (Asian preparations)

</FeatureBox>

<Callout type="tip" title="Costa Rican Style">
  Many Costa Ricans enjoy pomarrosa sprinkled with lime juice and a pinch of
  salt—this combination enhances the rose flavor and adds a refreshing contrast.
  It's a popular way to eat the fruit on hot summer days.

## Distribution in Costa Rica

### Where to Find

<DataTable
  headers={["Region", "Abundance", "Notes"]}
  rows={[
    ["Central Valley", "Very common", "Gardens, parks, streets"],
    ["Alajuela", "Common", "Coffee farms, gardens"],

    ["Cartago", "Common", "Rural and urban areas"],
    ["Heredia", "Common", "Coffee region"],
    ["Pacific slope", "Moderate", "Lower elevations"],
    ["Caribbean", "Less common", "Some naturalized"],
  ]}
/>

### Naturalization Status

<Callout type="warning" title="Naturalized Species">
  The Pomarrosa is considered **naturalized** in Costa Rica and some other tropical regions. While valued as an ornamental and fruit tree, it can spread aggressively in disturbed areas and along waterways. In some locations, it's considered invasive and can displace native vegetation.

**In Costa Rica**: Generally well-integrated into the landscape and not considered a major invasive threat, but its spread is monitored in some conservation areas.

</Callout>

## The Syzygium Family

The Pomarrosa belongs to a large genus with many edible members:

<DataTable
  headers={["Species", "Common Name", "Fruit Color", "Also in CR?"]}
  rows={[
    ["S. jambos", "Rose Apple (THIS)", "Yellow", "Very common"],
    ["S. malaccense", "Malay Apple", "Red/pink", "Common"],
    ["S. samarangense", "Water Apple", "Pink/white", "Less common"],
    ["S. cumini", "Java Plum", "Purple", "Occasionally"],
    ["S. aqueum", "Water Apple", "White/pink", "Rare"],
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="info" title="Manzana de Agua Connection">
  The related Manzana de Agua (_Syzygium malaccense_), which is also common in
  Costa Rica, is a close relative with larger, red fruits. Both species are
  sometimes confused, but the Pomarrosa's yellow color and stronger rose
  fragrance make it easily distinguishable.

## Conservation Status

<Callout type="info" title="Conservation Notes">
  **IUCN Status**: Least Concern (LC) in native range

**In Costa Rica**:
The Pomarrosa is not threatened—quite the opposite. As an introduced species that has naturalized, it requires no protection and may even need management in some conservation areas where it competes with native vegetation.

**Balance**:

- Valued ornamental and fruit tree
- Important in traditional gardens
- Monitored in protected areas
- Part of Costa Rica's cultural landscape

</Callout>

## Cultural Significance

<Callout type="leaf" title="A Adopted Tree">
  Though introduced from Asia, the Pomarrosa has become thoroughly Costa Rican.
  It graces countless gardens, school patios, and park corners throughout the
  Central Valley. The experience of picking ripe rose apples on a warm
  afternoon, their fragrance filling the air, is a shared memory for many Costa
  Ricans. This adopted tree has earned its place in the country's botanical and
  cultural heritage.
