# Pomarrosa (Rose Apple)

<Callout type="success" title="The Rose-Scented Fruit Tree">
  The **Pomarrosa** (_Syzygium jambos_), known in English as Rose Apple, is a
  beloved ornamental and fruit tree found throughout Costa Rica. Originally from
  Southeast Asia, this fragrant tree has naturalized so thoroughly that many
  consider it a local species. The yellow, rose-scented fruits are
  unmistakable—crisp, refreshing, and perfumed. For generations of Costa Ricans,
  the Pomarrosa represents summer afternoons and garden shade.

## Distribution in Costa Rica

### Where to Find

<DataTable
  headers={["Region", "Abundance", "Notes"]}
  rows={[
    ["Central Valley", "Very common", "Gardens, parks, streets"],
    ["Alajuela", "Common", "Coffee farms, gardens"],

  ]}

### Naturalization Status

<Callout type="warning" title="Naturalized Species">
  The Pomarrosa is considered **naturalized** in Costa Rica and some other tropical regions. While valued as an ornamental and fruit tree, it can spread aggressively in disturbed areas and along waterways. In some locations, it's considered invasive and can displace native vegetation.

**In Costa Rica**: Generally well-integrated into the landscape and not considered a major invasive threat, but its spread is monitored in some conservation areas.

## The Syzygium Family

The Pomarrosa belongs to a large genus with many edible members:

<DataTable
  headers={["Species", "Common Name", "Fruit Color", "Also in CR?"]}
  rows={[
    ["S. jambos", "Rose Apple (THIS)", "Yellow", "Very common"],
    ["S. malaccense", "Malay Apple", "Red/pink", "Common"],
    ["S. samarangense", "Water Apple", "Pink/white", "Less common"],
    ["S. cumini", "Java Plum", "Purple", "Occasionally"],
    ["S. aqueum", "Water Apple", "White/pink", "Rare"],
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="info" title="Manzana de Agua Connection">
  The related Manzana de Agua (_Syzygium malaccense_), which is also common in
  Costa Rica, is a close relative with larger, red fruits. Both species are
  sometimes confused, but the Pomarrosa's yellow color and stronger rose
  fragrance make it easily distinguishable.
