# Surá

<Callout type="warning" title="A Rainforest Giant Under Pressure">
  **Surá** (_Terminalia oblonga_) is one of Costa Rica's most impressive
  rainforest trees—a true emergent giant that towers above the main canopy on
  massive buttressed roots. This tree produces some of the finest construction
  timber in the Neotropics, comparable to teak in durability and workability.
  Unfortunately, this very quality has made Surá a target for intensive logging,
  and large specimens are increasingly rare outside protected areas.
  Understanding and protecting this magnificent species is essential for
  maintaining both forest ecosystems and sustainable forestry options for the
  future.

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

<Callout type="tip" title="Terminalia Pattern: Terminal Leaves">
  The genus name _Terminalia_ refers to the distinctive leaf arrangement where
  leaves cluster at the **ends (termini)** of branches: **Looking for
  Terminalia**: - Branches have bare sections - Leaves bunch at the tips -
  Creates distinctive "bottlebrush" pattern - Visible even from below Combined
  with the massive buttresses, this makes Surá identifiable even among other
  rainforest giants!

## Ecological Role

### Forest Giant Functions

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Canopy Architecture

- **Emergent status**: Extends above main canopy
- **Light capture**: Accesses full sunlight
- **Rain interception**: Influences local hydrology
- **Wind protection**: Shelters understory
- **Microclimate creation**: Shaded zones below

</Column>
<Column>

#### Wildlife Habitat

- **Cavity nesting**: Large branches host cavities
- **Epiphyte support**: Bark hosts orchids, bromeliads
- **Seed dispersal**: Wind-dispersed, also eaten by some birds
- **Perching**: Large branches for raptors
- **Frugivore feeding**: Seeds attract some wildlife

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

<Callout type="info" title="Buttresses: Engineering Marvels">
  The massive buttresses of Surá serve multiple functions: **Structural
  Support**: - Distribute weight on shallow tropical soils - Resist wind throw
  in storms - Anchor the tall trunk **Nutrient Capture**: - Large surface area
  catches leaf litter - Creates nutrient-rich pockets - Supports specialized
  root growth **Habitat Creation**: - Cavities between buttresses shelter
  animals - Collect water in wet season - Hide small mammals and amphibians
  Buttresses are a characteristic adaptation of tropical rainforest giants to
  shallow, nutrient-poor soils!

  Surá wood is considered among the finest construction timbers in Central
  America: **Physical Properties**: - Density: 0.55-0.70 g/cm³ (moderate to
  heavy) - Grain: Straight to interlocked - Texture: Medium to fine - Color:
  Yellowish-brown heartwood - Sapwood: Paler, clearly distinct **Working
  Qualities**: - Excellent workability - Takes finishes well - Good nail/screw
  holding - Machines smoothly - Moderate drying difficulty **Durability**: -
  Naturally resistant to decay - Resistant to termites - Good ground contact
  performance - Long service life

<Callout type="warning" title="The Cost of Quality">
  Surá's excellent timber properties have been its undoing: **Historical Logging
  Pressure**: - One of the most sought-after species - Systematically targeted
  for decades - Large trees increasingly rare - Regeneration insufficient to
  replace harvest **Current Status**: - Vulnerable on IUCN Red List - Large
  specimens mostly in protected areas - Plantation interest growing - Need for
  sustainable management **Conservation Need**: - Protect remaining wild
  populations - Establish seed collection programs - Develop plantation systems
  - Enforce harvest regulations

## The Future of Surá

<Callout type="info" title="A Timber Tree's Crossroads">
  Surá embodies the challenge of tropical forest conservation: **The Dilemma**:
  - Exceptional timber quality creates demand - Long growth time limits
  sustainable harvest - Wild populations depleted by past logging - Plantation
  forestry not yet widespread **Paths Forward**: 1. **Strict protection** of
  remaining populations 2. **Plantation development** for future timber needs 3.
  **Selective harvest** with long rotations 4. **Market incentives** for
  certified sustainable sources 5. **Research** into faster growth methods
  **Hope**: - Species is resilient if given protection - Interest in plantation
  forestry growing - Value could drive conservation investment - Genetic
  resources still available Surá can have a future as both a wild rainforest
  giant and a plantation crop—but only with deliberate conservation effort.

<Callout type="success" title="Giant of the Green Cathedral">
  Standing at the base of a mature Surá, neck craned upward, you feel what
  "rainforest giant" truly means. The massive buttresses spread around you like
  the roots of some ancient temple, their smooth gray surfaces rising meters
  above your head before merging into a trunk that climbs straight and true
  toward the distant canopy. Far above, the crown bursts into sunlight that the
  forest floor will never see, catching the trade winds that carry its winged
  seeds across the lowland forests. This single tree has stood perhaps for
  centuries, weathering storms, sequestering carbon, and supporting an invisible
  ecosystem of epiphytes, insects, and vertebrates in its branches. It's a
  cathedral column in the green church of the rainforest—and like the old-growth
  forests of other continents, it's becoming rare. The same qualities that make
  Surá magnificent—its size, its durability, its straight strong wood—have made
  it a target. Protecting the remaining giants while developing sustainable
  alternatives is one of the key challenges of tropical forestry. When you see a
  Surá standing proud in a protected reserve, you're seeing both a survivor and
  a seed bank for the future.
