# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "moderate"
toxicParts:
  - "nut-shell"
  - "sap"
skinContactRisk: "severe"
allergenRisk: "high"
structuralRisks: []
childSafe: false
petSafe: false
requiresProfessionalCare: true
toxicityDetails: "RAW CASHEW NUTS ARE TOXIC. Never eat unprocessed cashews. The nut shell contains urushiol and anacardic acid - the same toxins in poison ivy. Raw nuts cause severe oral burns, blistering, gastrointestinal distress, and can be fatal. Commercial cashews are always roasted or heat-processed to destroy toxins. The cashew apple (false fruit) is safe to eat. Seeds can cause digestive upset in pets. Never attempt to process raw cashew nuts at home - this requires industrial safety equipment."
skinContactDetails: "EXTREME CAUTION REQUIRED. The nut shell liquid contains urushiol and anacardic acid in high concentrations - causes SEVERE chemical burns, painful blistering, and allergic dermatitis on contact. Traditional processing methods cause serious burns to workers' hands. The sap from any part of the tree can also cause contact dermatitis. Reactions are typically more severe than poison ivy. Burning cashew shells releases toxic fumes that cause respiratory damage and temporary blindness. Never attempt to roast cashew nuts over open fire. Industrial processing uses protective equipment and controlled heating."
allergenDetails: "People with poison ivy/oak sensitivity are at very high risk. Tree sap can cause allergic reactions. Cashew nut allergy (to processed nuts) affects 0.5-1% of population and can be severe, including anaphylaxis. Cross-reactivity with pistachio and mango common (same family). Wood dust can cause respiratory sensitization."
safetyNotes: "NEVER eat raw cashew nuts or attempt home processing. Only eat commercially processed cashews that have been roasted/steamed. The cashew apple is safe and delicious when ripe. Wear gloves when handling raw nuts or tree parts. Keep children and pets away from fallen nuts. If you must handle raw materials, use protective equipment. Seek immediate medical attention if raw nut is ingested or severe skin reaction occurs. Professional nut processors use controlled heating, ventilation, and protective gear. This is NOT a DIY activity."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "fast"
growthRateDetails: "3-4 ft/year; begins producing nuts in 3-5 years from grafted trees, seedlings take 5-7 years"
matureSize: "6-14 m tall, spreading crown 8-15 m wide (low, wide tree)"
hardiness: "Lowland tropical; 0-800m elevation; thrives in hot dry areas, sensitive to frost"
soilRequirements: "Highly adaptable; grows in poor sandy soils; prefers well-drained sandy-loam; pH 4.5-6.5; tolerates infertile conditions"
waterNeeds: "low"
waterDetails: "Extremely drought-tolerant once established. Water young trees 1-2 times weekly in dry season for first year. Mature trees survive on rainfall alone, even in dry regions. Actually prefers drier conditions (reduces fungal diseases). Can tolerate extended drought."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plant 8-12 m from buildings and other trees; develops low, spreading crown"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
  - "grafting"
  - "air-layering"
propagationDifficulty: "easy"
plantingSeason: "Start of rainy season (May-June) ideal; can plant in dry season with irrigation"
maintenanceNeeds: "VERY LOW maintenance tree. Years 1-2: water during establishment, protect young tree from livestock. No fertilization needed (thrives in poor soils). Years 3-5 (first production): prune to develop open crown for better air circulation (reduces anthracnose). Remove dead branches. Years 5+: virtually maintenance-free. Harvest cashew apples when fully colored and soft. Harvest nuts attached to apples. DO NOT attempt to process nuts yourself—requires professional equipment. Can sell to processors or plant for cashew apples only (excellent juice). Tolerates neglect well."
commonProblems:
  - "Anthracnose fungus damages cashew apples in wet conditions - plant in drier areas, ensure good air flow"
  - "Tea mosquito and leaf miner insects - usually minor, monitor during flowering"
  - "Powdery mildew in humid conditions - provide good spacing and air circulation"
  - "Nut shell causes severe burns - NEVER attempt home processing, educate family about hazards"
  - "Cashew apples spoil quickly - harvest when ripe, process immediately for juice/wine"
  - "Birds and wildlife eat cashew apples - harvest promptly or share with wildlife"

# Marañón (Cashew Tree)

<Callout type="success" title="A Nut Like No Other">
  The **Marañón** or **Cashew** (_Anacardium occidentale_) produces the world's
  most peculiar and valuable nut. Unlike any other nut, the kidney-shaped cashew
  hangs **outside** its fruit—a fleshy, colorful "apple" that is itself
  delicious. Native to Brazil but spread throughout the tropics by Portuguese
  colonizers, the Cashew has become vital to economies from India to Vietnam,
  from Mozambique to Costa Rica. Every cashew nut you've ever eaten was
  hand-processed—the caustic shell requires careful handling—making this humble
  nut far more fascinating than most people realize. In Costa Rica, the marañón
  is a common sight in hot lowland areas, appreciated for both its nuts and its
  juicy, tart-sweet "apple."

  and outer casing contains **anacardic acid** and **cardol**—chemicals related
  to poison ivy that cause severe burns. - Can blister skin on contact - Fumes
  from burning shells are dangerous - Professional processing required - This is
  why raw cashews are never sold in shells The nut inside is perfectly safe once
  properly processed!

## The Cashew Paradox

### Why Can't You Buy Cashews in Shells?

<FeatureBox title="The World's Most Labor-Intensive Nut" icon="🥜">
  Unlike almonds, walnuts, or peanuts, cashews are **never sold in shells**:
  **The Problem**: - Shell contains caustic CNSL (Cashew Nut Shell Liquid) -
  Same chemical family as poison ivy - Cannot be cracked like other nuts -
  Requires heat treatment and careful extraction **Traditional Processing**: 1.
  Nuts dried for days 2. Roasted/steamed to neutralize toxins 3. Shells cracked
  individually by hand 4. Kernels extracted and graded 5. Often roasted again
  for sale **Modern Processing**: - Steam or oil-bath treatment - Mechanical
  cracking - Still significant hand labor - CNSL is a valuable industrial
  byproduct Every cashew represents considerable human labor—hence the price!

### The Cashew Apple

<Callout type="tip" title="The Forgotten Fruit">
  While the nut is exported worldwide, the cashew apple is often wasted: **In
  Producing Countries**: - Eaten fresh (sweet-tart flavor) - Made into juice
  (very popular) - Fermented into wine/liquor (Feni in Goa) - Made into jams and
  chutneys **In Costa Rica**: - Eaten fresh when ripe - Made into "refresco de
  marañón" - Sometimes fermented - Often simply left on tree **Why Not
  Exported?**: - Extremely delicate (bruises easily) - Shelf life of only hours
  to days - High in tannins (can be astringent) 5-10 times more apple than nut
  is produced—but most is discarded!

<Callout type="success" title="A Nutty Marvel">
  The humble Cashew is anything but ordinary. Consider this: every single cashew
  nut you've ever eaten was carefully extracted from a caustic shell by human
  hands, processed through multiple steps, and shipped halfway around the world.
  The tree itself is a survivor, thriving in poor, sandy soils where other crops
  fail. And the forgotten cashew apple—delicious, nutritious, and almost
  entirely wasted—represents one of the great missed opportunities in tropical
  fruit. In Costa Rica's dry Pacific lowlands, the marañón stands as a testament
  to Portuguese colonial-era plant exchanges, Brazilian origins, and the global
  journey of a truly remarkable nut. Next time you snack on cashews, spare a
  thought for this fascinating tree and the extraordinary journey those little
  kidney-shaped kernels made to reach you.
