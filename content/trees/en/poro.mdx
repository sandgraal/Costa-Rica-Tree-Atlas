# Poró

<Callout type="tip" title="The Coffee Shade Tree">
  **Poró** (_Erythrina poeppigiana_), also known as the Coral Bean Tree or
  Mountain Immortelle, is one of Costa Rica's most beloved and economically
  important trees. Its spectacular orange-red flowers herald the dry season, and
  its role as a shade tree has been inseparable from Costa Rican coffee culture
  for over a century.

## Cultural & Economic Importance

### The Coffee Connection

<FeatureBox title="Poró: The Heart of Costa Rican Coffee" icon="☕">
  For over a century, Poró has been the quintessential shade tree in Costa
  Rica's coffee plantations. The traditional **"café bajo sombra"** (shade-grown
  coffee) system relies heavily on Poró for its multiple benefits: shade
  regulation, nitrogen input, organic mulch from fallen leaves, and protection
  from temperature extremes.
</FeatureBox>

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Benefits for Coffee

- **Optimal Shade**: 40-60% canopy cover ideal for arabica
- **Nitrogen Boost**: Reduces need for synthetic fertilizers
- **Leaf Mulch**: Fallen leaves add organic matter
- **Temperature Buffer**: Protects from frost and heat
- **Moisture Retention**: Reduces irrigation needs
- **Pest Control**: Supports beneficial insects and birds

</Column>
<Column>

#### Agroforestry Systems

The Poró integrates into multiple farming systems:

- **Coffee-Poró**: Traditional Central Valley system
- **Cacao-Poró**: Caribbean lowland plantations
- **Silvopastoral**: Shade for cattle pastures
- **Living Fences**: Property boundaries and windbreaks
- **Alley Cropping**: Rows between annual crops

## Cultivation & Propagation

### Growing Poró

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Propagation Methods

**From Cuttings (Most Common)**

1. Select mature branches 30-60 cm long, 3-5 cm diameter
2. Make clean diagonal cut at base
3. Plant directly in prepared hole (30-50 cm deep)
4. Water well and stake if needed
5. Roots develop within 2-4 weeks
6. Success rate: 80-95%

**From Seeds**

1. Scarify seed coat (nick with file or soak in hot water)
2. Plant in nursery bags with well-drained soil
3. Keep moist but not waterlogged
4. Germination in 2-3 weeks
5. Transplant when 30-50 cm tall
6. Note: Seeds are toxic—handle carefully

</Column>
<Column>

#### Growing Conditions

<SimpleList
  items={[
    "Sun: Full sun to partial shade",
    "Soil: Fertile, well-drained, pH 5.5-7.0",
    "Water: Moderate; tolerates seasonal drought",
    "Elevation: Best at 400-2,000 m",
    "Spacing: 8-12 m for shade trees",
    "Pruning: Regular pollarding encourages regrowth",
  ]}
/>

#### Management Tips

- **Pollarding**: Cut main branches every 2-3 years to control size
- **Timing**: Prune after flowering and before rainy season
- **Mulching**: Leave pruned material around base
- **Pests**: Watch for stem borers and scale insects
- **Companion Planting**: Excellent with coffee, cacao, citrus

<Callout type="tip" title="See Poró in Costa Rica">
  The best time to see Poró in full bloom is **January through March** when the
  trees are leafless and covered in brilliant orange-red flowers. Visit any
  traditional coffee farm in the Central Valley, or look for them along
  roadsides throughout the highlands. The town of **Santo Domingo de Heredia**
  and the **Orosi Valley** offer particularly beautiful displays.
