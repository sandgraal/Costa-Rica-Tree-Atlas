### Taxonomic Notes

The species was originally described by C.K. Allen. The genus _Nectandra_ includes approximately 114 species distributed throughout tropical and subtropical America, with many species found in montane forests. The genus name comes from Greek _nektar_ (nectar) and _andros_ (male), referring to the nectar-secreting stamens.

Recent molecular studies have sometimes placed this species in the genus _Damburneya_, but _Nectandra salicina_ remains the most widely used scientific name.

### Etymology

- **Nectandra**: From Greek, referring to nectar-producing stamens
- **salicina**: Latin, meaning "willow-like," referring to the lanceolate leaf shape similar to willow leaves

## Physical/Botanical Description

### Tree Form

Quizarrá is a small to medium evergreen tree, typically 5-20 meters tall depending on environmental conditions. In exposed sites or at higher elevations, trees tend to be smaller (5-10 m), while in protected forest settings they can reach 15-20 meters. The tree has a straight to slightly irregular trunk and a compact, rounded crown typical of understory species.

### Bark

The bark is gray to grayish-brown, smooth on young trees, becoming slightly rougher with age but never deeply furrowed. The bark remains relatively thin throughout the tree's life. When cut, the bark may have a faint aromatic scent typical of Lauraceae.

### Leaves

<PropertiesGrid>
  <PropertyCard icon="🍃" label="Arrangement" value="Alternate" />
  <PropertyCard icon="📏" label="Size" value="6-11 cm long, 2-3.4 cm wide" />
  <PropertyCard
    icon="✨"
    label="Texture"
    value="Shiny above, less so beneath"
  />
  <PropertyCard icon="🌿" label="Type" value="Simple, lanceolate" />
</PropertiesGrid>

The leaves are one of the tree's most distinctive features. They are lanceolate (lance-shaped), with an entire margin and acute to acuminate tip. The upper surface is glossy dark green, while the lower surface is paler and matte. When crushed, the leaves emit a characteristic aromatic, spicy scent due to essential oils – this is an excellent field identification feature.

Leaves are attached by slender, glabrous (hairless) petioles about 1-1.5 cm long. The venation is pinnate, with the midrib prominent on both surfaces.

### Flowers

<PropertiesGrid>
  <PropertyCard icon="🌸" label="Color" value="White to pale yellow-green" />
  <PropertyCard icon="📏" label="Size" value="Small, 2-3 mm" />
  <PropertyCard icon="🌿" label="Arrangement" value="Axillary panicles" />
  <PropertyCard icon="📅" label="Season" value="March-May" />
</PropertiesGrid>

The flowers are small and inconspicuous, typical of Lauraceae. They are arranged in axillary panicles (branched clusters) up to 12 cm long. Individual flowers are only 2-3 mm in diameter, with a tubular perianth (tepals) that is white to pale yellow or greenish. The flowers are perfect (bisexual), with 9 stamens arranged in three whorls. The outer stamens produce nectar from glands at their base.

Flowering occurs primarily in the early dry season (March-May), when the tree produces numerous flower clusters that attract small insects for pollination.

### Fruit & Seeds

The fruit is a small berry, subglobose (nearly round) in shape, approximately 1.5-2 cm in diameter. Immature fruits are green, becoming dark blue-black when ripe. The fruit sits in a distinctive red cupule (cup-like structure) at the base, which helps identify the genus _Nectandra_. The cupule remains attached to the peduncle after the fruit is taken by birds or falls.

Each fruit contains a single large seed. The fruits ripen from June through September and are an important food source for birds and small mammals in cloud forest ecosystems.

## Growing Quizarrá

### Propagation

**From Seed**: Seeds should be collected from ripe fruits (dark blue-black) in July-September. Clean seeds of pulp and plant immediately, as they may not store well. Germination can be slow and erratic (2-4 months). Sow in shaded nursery conditions in organic-rich potting mix.

**From Cuttings**: Semi-hardwood cuttings can be attempted but success rates are variable. Use rooting hormone and maintain high humidity.

### Site Selection

Choose a site that mimics natural cloud forest conditions:

- **Elevation**: Best above 800 m in Costa Rica
- **Shade**: Partial to full shade, especially for young trees
- **Protection**: Sheltered from strong winds
- **Moisture**: Area with consistent fog/mist or high humidity

### Planting

1. Plant during rainy season (May-November)
2. Dig hole twice the size of root ball
3. Amend soil with compost/organic matter
4. Plant at same depth as in container
5. Water thoroughly and mulch around base
6. Provide shade cloth if necessary

### Care Requirements

<PropertiesGrid>
  <PropertyCard icon="☀️" label="Light" value="Partial shade" />
  <PropertyCard icon="💧" label="Water" value="Keep consistently moist" />
  <PropertyCard icon="🌡️" label="Temperature" value="Cool (12-25°C)" />
  <PropertyCard icon="🪴" label="Soil" value="Rich, organic, well-drained" />
</PropertiesGrid>

**Watering**: Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. In areas without natural fog/mist, supplement with regular irrigation.

**Fertilizing**: Generally not necessary if planted in organic-rich soil. A light application of balanced organic fertilizer annually may benefit young trees.

**Pruning**: Minimal pruning needed. Remove dead or damaged branches as necessary.

### Common Growing Problems

1. **Leaf burn in full sun**: Solution - Provide more shade
2. **Slow growth**: Solution - Be patient; this is normal for cloud forest species
3. **Root rot in poorly drained soil**: Solution - Improve drainage, don't overwater
4. **Stress in hot, dry conditions**: Solution - Increase humidity, shade, and moisture
