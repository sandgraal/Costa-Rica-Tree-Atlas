# Safety Information
toxicityLevel: "none"
toxicParts: []
skinContactRisk: "none"
allergenRisk: "none"
structuralRisks:
  - "sharp-spines"
childSafe: false
petSafe: true
requiresProfessionalCare: true
toxicityDetails: "The fruit is safe and nutritious when cooked. Heart of palm is safe to eat. No toxic parts - all safety concerns are physical (spines), not chemical."
skinContactDetails: "No chemical skin hazards. All safety concerns are from the sharp spines - see structural risks."
allergenDetails: "Pejibaye allergies are extremely rare. The fruit and heart of palm are generally well tolerated. No significant allergen concerns."
structuralRiskDetails: "EXTREME SPINE HAZARD. Pejibaye is covered in LONG, SHARP, NEEDLE-LIKE BLACK SPINES up to 15 cm (6 inches) long. These spines cover the trunk, leaf bases, and leaf stems. The spines are extremely sharp and can cause deep puncture wounds that are painful and prone to infection. DANGEROUS for children - they should not play near these palms. The spines can pierce through clothing and gloves. Injuries are common during harvesting. In plantations, workers use long poles to avoid contact. Fallen fronds retain spines and remain hazardous. Some cultivated varieties have been bred to be spineless or have reduced spines, but wild and most traditional varieties are HEAVILY armed. This palm should NOT be planted near paths, play areas, or where people might accidentally contact it."
safetyNotes: "FRUIT IS SAFE - SPINES ARE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. This is one of the spiniest palms. Keep children and visitors away. Never plant near walkways, playgrounds, or high-traffic areas. Harvesting and maintenance require extreme caution and protective equipment (thick gloves, long sleeves, face protection). If you have this palm, consider professional maintenance. Injuries from spines can become infected - seek medical attention if a spine breaks off under skin. Some modern cultivars have reduced spines, but assume all pejibaye are hazardous unless confirmed spineless variety. The fruit is delicious and nutritious (must be cooked), but the tree itself is not suitable for family gardens or public areas due to spine danger."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "moderate"
growthRateDetails: "Moderate to fast growth; 0.5-1 m/year; produces clumps of 10-20 stems from single planting; begins fruiting at 3-5 years from seed, 2-3 years from offshoots; reaches mature height (12-15 m) in 8-12 years"
matureSize: "12-20 m tall per stem, clumping habit with 10-20 stems forming dense clusters 4-6 m wide; leaves 3-4 m long; commercial plantations often limited to 15 stems per clump"
hardiness: "Humid tropical lowlands to mid-elevations; Costa Rica elevation 0-1200m; prefers humid Atlantic slope and Caribbean lowlands; requires 2500-4000 mm annual rainfall; NOT drought-tolerant; no frost tolerance"
soilRequirements: "Prefers deep, fertile, well-drained but moisture-retentive soils; ideal pH 5.5-6.5; thrives in volcanic soils and alluvial valleys; tolerates slightly acidic soils; does NOT tolerate waterlogged or very sandy soils; benefits from organic matter"
waterNeeds: "high"
waterDetails: "HIGH water needs - NOT drought-tolerant. Requires consistent moisture year-round. Young palms need watering 2-3 times per week. Mature palms need regular irrigation during dry periods - cannot withstand extended drought. Best suited to naturally humid areas (Caribbean slope, Pacific south). Irrigation essential in areas with distinct dry season. Performs poorly in dry climates."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plant 5-7 m apart for fruit production (allows clump development); 3-4 m spacing for heart of palm production (harvest before maturity); NOT suitable near paths or buildings due to spines"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
  - "offshoots"
propagationDifficulty: "easy"
plantingSeason: "Plant at start of rainy season (May-June) for best establishment; offshoots can be transplanted year-round with irrigation; seeds germinate in 2-3 months"
maintenanceNeeds: "MODERATE to HIGH maintenance. Years 1-3: water regularly (critical), fertilize quarterly with balanced NPK, weed around base, protect from wind. Years 4-7: continue irrigation/fertilization, thin clump to 10-15 productive stems, remove old fruited stems annually (DANGEROUS - requires protective gear). Mature palms: annual fertilization (especially potassium for fruit quality), consistent irrigation, selective thinning of stems, pest monitoring. Heart of palm production: harvest entire palm at 2-3 years (destructive). Fruit production: requires ongoing stem management. SAFETY: All maintenance tasks extremely hazardous due to spines - professional handling recommended."
commonProblems:
  - "EXTREME SPINE INJURIES - primary safety concern during all maintenance"
  - "Phytophthora bud rot - fatal disease in overly wet conditions"
  - "Red ring disease (nematode) - can kill entire clumps"
  - "Palm weevil borers - serious pest, inspect regularly"
  - "Fruit fly infestations - can damage entire crop"
  - "Nutritional deficiencies (especially potassium) - causes poor fruiting"
  - "Drought stress - causes fruit drop and reduced yields"
  - "Rodent damage to fruit - major issue in some areas"
  - "Requires spineless varieties for safe cultivation in gardens"

## Heart of Palm (Palmito)

### Premium Product

<Callout type="success" title="Sustainable Harvest">
  Costa Rica is a major producer of cultivated heart of palm from pejibaye. The
  clumping growth habit allows sustainable harvest—when one stem is cut, others
  continue growing and new ones emerge. This makes pejibaye palmito more
  environmentally friendly than heart of palm from single-stemmed palms that
  must be killed for harvest.

## Wood Properties

Although pejibaye is primarily grown for its fruit and heart of palm, its wood has remarkable characteristics:

<PropertiesGrid>
  <PropertyCard icon="🟤" label="Heartwood Color" value="Dark brown to black" />
  <PropertyCard icon="🟡" label="Sapwood Color" value="Light tan" />
  <PropertyCard icon="⚖️" label="Density" value="Very high (0.7–0.9 g/cm³)" />
  <PropertyCard
    icon="🔨"
    label="Workability"
    value="Difficult — extremely hard"
  />
  <PropertyCard

    label="Durability"
    value="Excellent — naturally rot-resistant"
  />
  <PropertyCard icon="📏" label="Grain" value="Fibrous, interlocked" />
</PropertiesGrid>

Pejibaye wood is one of the hardest and most durable natural materials available in the tropics:

- **Construction**: Traditional house posts, floor planks, roof beams — naturally resistant to termites and rot
- **Weapons & Tools**: Indigenous peoples made bows, arrows, spears, and digging sticks — still prized by traditional communities
- **Musical instruments**: Hollowed sections used for drums and percussion
- **Crafts & furniture**: Polished pejibaye wood has striking dark color and grain patterns — used for decorative items and walking sticks
- **Fencing**: Split trunks used for durable fence posts in rural areas

<Callout type="info" title="A Sustainable Alternative">
  Because pejibaye forms clumps of multiple stems, individual trunks can be
  harvested without killing the plant. This makes it one of the most sustainable
  sources of tropical hardwood. Some agroforestry projects now integrate
  pejibaye specifically for its dual timber-food value.

### Propagation Guide

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="🌱 Seed Propagation">

1. **Select fresh seeds** from ripe fruits (orange-red, soft when pressed)
2. **Remove pulp** — soak in water 24-48 hours, then clean thoroughly
3. **Pre-treat**: Soak cleaned seeds in warm water for 24 hours
4. **Plant 2-3 cm deep** in moist, well-drained nursery mix (50% sand, 50% compost)
5. **Temperature**: Maintain 25-30°C for optimal germination
6. **Germination time**: 2-3 months — be patient, germination is slow and irregular
7. **Keep moist**: Water every 2-3 days; never let medium dry out completely
8. **Note**: Seedling palms will be genetically variable — fruit quality unpredictable

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🌿 Offshoot (Sucker) Propagation — Preferred Method">

1. **Select healthy offshoots** 50-80 cm tall with own root system
2. **Timing**: Best at start of rainy season (May-June)
3. **Carefully separate** from mother clump using sharp machete — cut cleanly
4. **Retain roots**: Keep as much root system attached as possible
5. **Trim fronds** to reduce transpiration — leave 2-3 central leaves
6. **Plant immediately** in prepared hole with compost
7. **Water thoroughly** and keep consistently moist for first 3 months
8. **Advantage**: Produces fruit 1-2 years earlier than seed-grown; true-to-type

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🏡 Field Planting & Establishment">

1. **Site selection**: Choose well-drained area away from paths and buildings (spine hazard)
2. **Prepare hole**: 50 × 50 × 50 cm, mix excavated soil with 5 kg compost
3. **Spacing**: 5-7 m for fruit production; 3-4 m for heart of palm
4. **Plant at same depth** as in nursery — do not bury crown
5. **Mulch heavily**: 15-20 cm organic mulch in 1 m radius around base
6. **Stake** if exposed to wind; remove after 6 months
7. **Initial care**: Water 2-3 times weekly for first year; fertilize quarterly with NPK 15-15-15
8. **Clump management**: Thin to 10-15 stems per clump by year 5 for best production

</AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

### Varieties

<Callout type="info" title="Cultivated Diversity">
  Thousands of years of cultivation have produced great diversity in pejibaye.
  Varieties differ in fruit color (yellow to red), size, oil content, and
  seedlessness. Some "spineless" varieties have been developed for easier
  harvest, though these are less common. The CATIE research center in Turrialba,
  Costa Rica maintains one of the world's largest pejibaye germplasm
  collections.

## Interesting Facts

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="🌴 Only Domesticated American Palm">

Of the hundreds of palm species native to the Americas, pejibaye is the only
one fully domesticated for its fruit. This process began over 10,000 years ago
in the Amazon basin, making it one of the oldest cultivated plants in the New
World—predating corn and beans as a staple crop.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="⚔️ Traditional Weapons">

The extremely hard, dense wood of pejibaye trunks was prized for making
hunting weapons. Indigenous peoples crafted bows, arrows, and spears from it.
The wood is so hard that it can barely be nailed—drilling is required to
avoid splitting.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🍳 Can't Eat It Raw">

Raw pejibaye contains calcium oxalate crystals that cause intense throat
irritation. These compounds are destroyed by cooking, which is why the fruits
are always boiled before eating. The cooking time (30-60 minutes) also makes
the starchy flesh digestible and brings out the distinctive chestnut-like
flavor.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="🌱 Spineless Dreams">

Plant breeders have worked for decades to develop spineless pejibaye varieties
to make harvest easier. While some progress has been made, most commercial
varieties still have spines. The traditional harvest method uses very long
poles with hooks to cut fruit clusters from the ground—avoiding the dangerous
climb up the spiny trunk.

<Callout type="tip" title="Season Tips">
  The best time to experience pejibaye culture is **May through August** when
  fruits are abundant. Look for vendors selling bags of boiled pejibaye (usually
  ₡1,000-2,000 per bag) at roadsides, bus stops, and farmer's markets across the
  country. Always try them with mayonnaise — the traditional Costa Rican way!
