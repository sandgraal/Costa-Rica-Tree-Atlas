<AccordionItem title="🔬 Taxonomic Notes">

_Ficus_ is one of the largest genera of flowering plants with over 850 species. The species epithet _insipida_ means "tasteless," referring to the bland flavor of the fruit to humans (though wildlife find them delicious!).

**Relationship to other figs**: Unlike the strangler figs (like Matapalo), Chilamate typically grows from the ground rather than as an epiphyte. However, it can occasionally start as an epiphyte.

**Fig wasp symbiosis**: Like all figs, Chilamate has a unique pollination relationship with specific fig wasp species that enter the enclosed flower structure (syconium).
