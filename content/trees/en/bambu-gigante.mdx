# Bambu Gigante (Guadua)

<Callout type="tip" title="High-value structural bamboo">
  **Bambu Gigante** (_Guadua angustifolia_) is one of the most important
  construction bamboos in tropical America. In Costa Rica it can support
  agroforestry, erosion control, and low-carbon building systems when managed
  with regular thinning.

<AccordionItem title="🔎 Taxonomic Notes">

- _Guadua angustifolia_ is a giant clumping bamboo in **Poaceae**.
- It is technically a grass, but functionally treated as a woody canopy-forming
  plant in many agroforestry and restoration systems.
- Stand-level management is critical for structural quality and safety.

## Physical & Botanical Description

- Culms commonly reach **15-30 m** with thick woody walls.
- Clumps produce many culms of different ages from a shared rhizome base.
- Branching can be dense in upper sections; lower culms may be thorny in some
  management stages.
- Leaves are narrow, lanceolate, and abundant in mature stands.
- Flowering is infrequent and irregular, sometimes synchronized over large
  regions.

---

## Geographic Distribution

<DistributionMap
  locale="en"
  countries={["Colombia", "Ecuador", "Peru", "Costa Rica", "Panama", "Mexico"]}
  elevation="0-1800 m"
/>

In Costa Rica, giant bamboo is mostly cultivated in farms, riparian buffers,
and restoration projects rather than primary native forest.

---

## Habitat & Ecology

- Performs best in warm valleys and foothills with deep moisture-retentive
  soils.
- Excellent for slope stabilization and riverbank protection.
- Creates dense habitat for birds and small mammals.
- Requires active management to avoid over-dominance in mixed native plantings.

---

## Uses & Applications

### Construction and materials

- Engineered bamboo poles for housing and light structures.
- Fencing, scaffolding, furniture, and artisan products.
- Renewable source for low-carbon building material chains.

### Agroforestry and land management

- Windbreak and watercourse stabilization species.
- Biomass production for circular farm systems.
- Shade and microclimate regulation in mixed production landscapes.

---

## Conservation Status

**IUCN Red List:** Not Evaluated (NE).

The species is widely cultivated and regionally important, but sustainability
depends on responsible harvest cycles and clump management.

---

## Growing Bambu Gigante

1. Establish clumps with rhizome divisions at rainy-season onset.
2. Keep thick organic mulch to preserve soil moisture.
3. Thin old culms annually to stimulate healthy new shoot emergence.
4. Maintain root/rhizome boundaries near infrastructure.
5. Harvest mature culms on rotating cycles for structural quality.

Bambu gigante is highly productive when treated as a managed stand rather than
an unmanaged ornamental clump.

---

## Where to See Bambu Gigante in Costa Rica

- Agroforestry farms near **Turrialba** and **Cartago**.
- Riverbank stabilization projects in **San Carlos** and northern plains.
- Rural construction landscapes in **Pacific and Central Valley** regions.
- Botanical and sustainable-building demonstration sites.
