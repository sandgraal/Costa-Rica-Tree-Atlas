<AccordionItem title="🔎 Taxonomic Notes">

- _Guadua angustifolia_ is a giant clumping bamboo in **Poaceae**.
- It is technically a grass, but functionally treated as a woody canopy-forming
  plant in many agroforestry and restoration systems.
- Stand-level management is critical for structural quality and safety.

</AccordionItem>

## Physical & Botanical Description

- Culms commonly reach **15-30 m** with thick woody walls.
- Clumps produce many culms of different ages from a shared rhizome base.
- Branching can be dense in upper sections; lower culms may be thorny in some
  management stages.
- Leaves are narrow, lanceolate, and abundant in mature stands.
- Flowering is infrequent and irregular, sometimes synchronized over large
  regions.

---

## Geographic Distribution

<DistributionMap
  locale="en"
  countries={["Colombia", "Ecuador", "Peru", "Costa Rica", "Panama", "Mexico"]}
  elevation="0-1800 m"
/>

In Costa Rica, giant bamboo is mostly cultivated in farms, riparian buffers,
and restoration projects rather than primary native forest.

---

## Habitat & Ecology

- Performs best in warm valleys and foothills with deep moisture-retentive
  soils.
- Excellent for slope stabilization and riverbank protection.
- Creates dense habitat for birds and small mammals.
- Requires active management to avoid over-dominance in mixed native plantings.

---

## Uses & Applications

### Construction and materials

- Engineered bamboo poles for housing and light structures.
- Fencing, scaffolding, furniture, and artisan products.
- Renewable source for low-carbon building material chains.

### Agroforestry and land management

- Windbreak and watercourse stabilization species.
- Biomass production for circular farm systems.
- Shade and microclimate regulation in mixed production landscapes.

---

## Conservation Status

**IUCN Red List:** Not Evaluated (NE).

The species is widely cultivated and regionally important, but sustainability
depends on responsible harvest cycles and clump management.

---

## Growing Bambu Gigante

1. Establish clumps with rhizome divisions at rainy-season onset.
2. Keep thick organic mulch to preserve soil moisture.
3. Thin old culms annually to stimulate healthy new shoot emergence.
4. Maintain root/rhizome boundaries near infrastructure.
5. Harvest mature culms on rotating cycles for structural quality.

Bambu gigante is highly productive when treated as a managed stand rather than
an unmanaged ornamental clump.

---

## Advanced Care Guidance

### Site Design and Planting

- Establish clumps in deep alluvial or loamy soils with strong drainage and
  dependable moisture.
- Keep 8-12 m spacing between production clumps, depending on harvest access
  needs.
- Install containment design (trenches, root barriers, or service lanes) near
  roads, walls, and utilities.

### Watering Program

- **Establishment (0-12 months):** Deep watering 2 times weekly during dry
  periods to support rhizome expansion.
- **Juvenile stand (1-3 years):** Water every 7-10 days in prolonged drought,
  especially before shoot flushes.
- **Managed mature stand:** Supplemental irrigation during severe dry season to
  maintain culm quality and shoot survival.

### Fertilization Schedule

- Apply composted manure and mulch at planting to improve soil carbon and
  moisture retention.
- Fertilize at early and mid rainy season with balanced nutrients plus potassium
  support for culm strength.
- Recycle leaf litter and branch residues inside the stand to reduce external
  input needs.

### Pruning and Stand Structure

- Thin weak, damaged, or overcrowded culms every year after rainy-season growth.
- Maintain mixed age classes so each clump contains young, mature, and harvest
  ready culms.
- Keep internal access lanes clear for airflow, safe harvest movement, and
  reduced pest pressure.

### Pest and Disease Management

- Scout for stem borers, fungal staining, and shoot dieback in humid low-airflow
  conditions.
- Remove and destroy heavily infected culms to protect stand productivity.
- Use sanitation-first management and avoid unnecessary broad-spectrum chemical
  treatments.

### Companion Planting

- **Recommended companions:** Cacao, Guaba species, plantain strips, and
  soil-binding native shrubs.
- **Agroforestry role:** Wind buffering, erosion control, and renewable
  structural biomass.
- **Avoid nearby:** Septic fields, shallow foundations, and unmanaged narrow
  urban plots.

### Seasonal Care Calendar (Costa Rican Conditions)

- **Dry season (Dec-Apr):** Irrigation support, culm inventory, and harvest
  planning.
- **Early rains (May-Jul):** Main planting and rhizome division window;
  fertilization and mulch renewal.
- **Peak rains (Aug-Oct):** Disease scouting, drainage maintenance, and selective
  thinning.
- **Transition (Nov):** Harvest cycle review and stand sanitation before dry
  stress period.

### Growth Timeline and Production Notes

- New culms emerge rapidly during favorable moisture and reach full height in a
  single season.
- Structural maturity for construction use commonly develops after 3-4 years per
  culm.
- Productivity is highest when harvest rotation and clump sanitation remain
  consistent year after year.

## Where to See Bambu Gigante in Costa Rica

- Agroforestry farms near **Turrialba** and **Cartago**.
- Riverbank stabilization projects in **San Carlos** and northern plains.
- Rural construction landscapes in **Pacific and Central Valley** regions.
