childSafe: true
petSafe: false
requiresProfessionalCare: false
toxicityDetails: "Eucalyptus deglupta leaves contain low to moderate levels of eucalyptus oils (cineole and related terpenoids). Ingestion of large quantities of leaves could cause mild gastrointestinal upset in humans. The oils are not as concentrated as in temperate eucalyptus species. Overall human ingestion risk is low."
skinContactDetails: "Contact with bark, leaves, and sap is generally non-irritating. The shedding bark is smooth and inert. Sawdust from milling can cause mild respiratory or skin irritation in workers without protective equipment. No significant dermatitis risk for casual contact."
allergenDetails: "Pollen production is moderate and flower scent mild. Eucalyptus pollen is not a major allergen in most populations. Wood dust is a minor occupational irritant. Risk is low for general public interaction."
structuralRiskDetails: "Rainbow Eucalyptus grows extremely fast and can develop brittle wood and weak branch attachments. Large branches may shed without warning, especially during storms or after drought stress. Very tall specimens pose significant structural risks in urban areas. Regular arborist inspections are essential for trees near buildings and paths."
safetyNotes: "Rainbow Eucalyptus is visually spectacular and generally safe for public enjoyment at a reasonable distance. Main risks are structural (branch drop from tall specimens) and pet ingestion (eucalyptus oils are toxic to cats and dogs in concentrated forms). As with all very tall fast-growing trees, professional monitoring is wise in high-traffic areas."
wildlifeRisks: "Eucalyptus oils in leaves and bark can be harmful to some animals if consumed in quantity. Koalas have evolved tolerance, but Costa Rican wildlife has not. Dense eucalyptus plantations can reduce native biodiversity; mixed planting with native species is recommended. Flowers do provide nectar for some pollinator species."
# Care & Cultivation
growthRate: "fast"
growthRateDetails: "Very fast; 3-5 m per year in optimal humid tropical lowlands. One of the fastest-growing hardwood trees in the world."
matureSize: "60-75 m in native range; typically 25-40 m in Costa Rican plantations; crown spread 10-20 m"
hardiness: "Tropical lowlands only; no frost tolerance; requires humid conditions with regular rainfall"
soilRequirements: "Prefers deep, well-drained, fertile soils. Tolerates laterites and moderately acidic substrates. Performs poorly on permanently waterlogged, calcareous, or very shallow soils."
waterNeeds: "high"
waterDetails: "High. Best growth with 2000-4000 mm annual rainfall. Unlike many eucalyptus species, E. deglupta is not drought-tolerant and requires consistent moisture. Supplemental irrigation essential in dry periods."
lightRequirements: "full-sun"
spacing: "Plant 4x4 m for pulpwood plantations; 8-12 m in mixed systems; 15-20 m for specimen ornamental trees"
propagationMethods:
  - "seeds"
  - "seedlings"
  - "cuttings"
propagationDifficulty: "moderate"
plantingSeason: "Onset of rainy season (May-July); container stock can be planted through rainy season with adequate moisture"
maintenanceNeeds: "Moderate. Requires attention to structural pruning given fast growth and potentially weak branch unions. Thin plantations at 3-5 years. Maintain mulch and moisture for young trees. Monitor bark shedding patterns and branch integrity. Remove volunteer seedlings if appearing outside intended planting areas."
commonProblems:
  - "Brittle branch attachment leading to storm damage"
  - "Leaf litter allelopathy suppressing understory growth"
  - "High water demand competing with surrounding vegetation"
  - "Psyllid infestations on new growth"
  - "Stem canker in humid conditions"

# Rainbow Eucalyptus (Eucalipto)

<Callout type="tip" title="The World's Most Colorful Tree">
  **Rainbow Eucalyptus** (_Eucalyptus deglupta_), known in Costa Rica as
  **Eucalipto**, is perhaps the most visually extraordinary tree on Earth. Its
  smooth bark peels in strips to reveal a stunning palette of green, blue,
  orange, maroon, and purple — a natural work of art. Unlike most eucalyptus
  species, this one is truly tropical, native to the rainforests of Southeast
  Asia. In Costa Rica, it graces botanical gardens, parks, and plantations
  across the humid lowlands.

### Global Context

_Eucalyptus deglupta_ is native to the islands of Mindanao (Philippines),
Sulawesi and Seram (Indonesia), and parts of Papua New Guinea. Unlike most
eucalyptus species confined to Australia, _E. deglupta_ evolved in the
equatorial rainforests of insular Southeast Asia. It has been planted across the
wet tropics worldwide — in Hawaii, Central America, Brazil, West Africa, and
India — primarily for pulpwood production and ornamental display.

### Distribution in Costa Rica

In Costa Rica, Rainbow Eucalyptus appears in:

- **Caribbean lowlands** (Limón province — most extensive plantations)
- **Southern Pacific lowlands** (Osa Peninsula area, humid plantations)
- **Central Valley botanical gardens** (ornamental specimens at parks and estates)
- **Northern Zone** (experimental plantings in humid zones)
- **University and institutional campuses** (demonstration and educational plantings)

The species requires consistent humidity and is absent from the dry Pacific
(Guanacaste) except where artificially irrigated.

### Naturalization and Spread

<Callout type="info" title="Low invasion risk in Costa Rica">
  Unlike some Australian eucalyptus species that become invasive in fire-prone
  landscapes, _E. deglupta_ has shown limited naturalization tendency in Costa
  Rica. Its requirement for high rainfall and intolerance of drought and fire
  constrain its spread. However, monitoring in humid lowland forest edges is
  still recommended as a precaution.

### Environmental Preferences

<DataTable
  headers={["Factor", "Preferred", "Tolerance"]}
  rows={[
    [
      "Rainfall",
      "2000-4000 mm/year",
      "Minimum ~1500 mm; no prolonged dry season",

    ["Soil", "Deep fertile loam", "Moderately acidic laterites"],
    ["Light", "Full sun", "Shade-intolerant; pioneer canopy strategy"],
  ]}
/>

### Unique Bark Ecology

The rainbow bark phenomenon occurs because _E. deglupta_ continuously sheds its
outer bark in thin strips throughout the year. Freshly exposed inner bark is
bright green (photosynthetically active), then gradually matures through blue,
purple, orange, and maroon as it ages and oxidizes. Because different strips
shed at different times, the trunk displays a mosaic of colors simultaneously.

<DataTable
  headers={["Bark stage", "Color", "Biology"]}

    ["Fresh exposure", "Bright green", "Photosynthetic chlorophyll layer"],
    ["1-2 weeks", "Blue to teal", "Chlorophyll oxidation begins"],

    "Windbreak function in coastal and lowland agricultural areas",
  ]}
/>

### Ecological Concerns

<Callout type="warning" title="Allelopathic effects">
  Like other eucalyptus species, _E. deglupta_ leaf litter contains compounds
  that can inhibit germination and growth of understory plants (allelopathy).
  This effect is generally milder than in Australian eucalyptus species but
  should be considered in mixed planting designs. High water consumption can
  also affect local water tables in dry periods.

## Botanical Description

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Tree Form" defaultOpen={true}>
    Rainbow Eucalyptus is one of the tallest tropical trees. In its native
    Philippines, specimens can exceed 75 m. In Costa Rica, planted trees
    typically reach 25-40 m but grow exceptionally fast.

    </PropertiesGrid>

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Bark — The Rainbow Feature">
    The signature rainbow bark is smooth and continuously shedding. Unlike
    rough-barked eucalyptus species, _E. deglupta_ never develops persistent
    bark plates. The trunk surface is always a shifting mosaic of colors.

    <Callout type="tip">
      The most vivid bark colors appear on young to mid-aged trees in humid
      conditions with regular rainfall. Older trees or those under drought
      stress may show less vibrant coloration.
    </Callout>

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Leaves">
    Leaves are simple, opposite on young shoots and alternate on older
    branches. They are lanceolate with a smooth margin and aromatic when
    crushed, though less intensely scented than Australian eucalyptus species.

    <DataTable

  </AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Flowers">
  Flowers are small, cream-white, arranged in umbels. They are less showy than
  the bark but produce nectar attractive to insects. Flowering occurs mostly in
  the transition between dry and wet seasons.
</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Fruit and Seeds">
    Fruit is a small woody capsule (5-8 mm diameter) that releases tiny seeds
    when mature. Seeds are wind-dispersed and very small (thousands per gram).

## Cultural & Economic Significance

### The Rainbow Bark as Cultural Icon

Rainbow Eucalyptus has become a social media and tourism phenomenon. Its bark
is widely photographed and shared online, making it one of the most visually
recognized tropical trees in the world. In Costa Rica, tourist-oriented
botanical collections feature the species prominently.

### Economic Context in Costa Rica

  headers={["Factor", "Detail"]}
  rows={[
    ["Primary use in CR", "Ornamental specimen planting"],
    ["Secondary use", "Small-scale pulpwood on Caribbean lowlands"],
    ["Rotation (pulp)", "5-8 years (very short rotation)"],
    [
      "Yield potential",
      "20-40 m³/ha/year (among highest for tropical hardwoods)",

    ["Tourism value", "Significant draw at botanical gardens and eco-lodges"],
    [
      "Market limitation",
      "Wood is too soft for structural timber; mainly chip/pulp",
    ],
  ]}
/>

### Conservation and Ethical Considerations

<Callout type="info" title="Plantation forestry ethics">
  While _E. deglupta_ plantations can rehabilitate degraded land and reduce
  pressure on native timber harvesting, they should not replace native forest
  ecosystems. In Costa Rica's wet lowlands, native species like _Vochysia
  guatemalensis_, _Terminalia amazonia_, and _Carapa guianensis_ provide
  superior ecological value. Rainbow Eucalyptus is best positioned as a
  complement to — not a substitute for — native restoration.

/>

### Pet Safety

<Callout type="warning" title="Eucalyptus oil toxicity in pets">
  Eucalyptus oils are toxic to cats and dogs. While _E. deglupta_ has lower oil
  concentrations than temperate species, fallen leaves should be cleared from
  areas where pets graze or play. Symptoms of eucalyptus poisoning in pets
  include drooling, vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy. Contact a veterinarian
  immediately if ingestion is suspected.
</Callout>

### Structural Safety for Very Tall Trees

- Rainbow Eucalyptus can grow to enormous size rapidly
- Branch shedding ("limb drop") is a known eucalyptus trait
- Schedule annual arborist inspections for urban specimens
- Maintain adequate clearance from buildings, power lines, and paths
- Root plates may lift in shallow soils during storms

## The Rainbow Bark: Understanding the Science

<Callout type="info" title="Why is the bark multicolored?">
  The rainbow effect is not pigmentation in the traditional sense. It results
  from the physical interaction of light with different stages of bark tissue:
  chlorophyll (green), oxidized tannins (orange-brown), and structural color
  effects. The continuous asynchronous bark shedding creates the mosaic pattern.

<Callout type="success" title="Living Art in the Tropical Landscape">
  Rainbow Eucalyptus is a tree that stops people in their tracks. Its natural
  bark mosaic is unmatched in the plant kingdom, and its extreme growth rate can
  transform degraded land in just a few years. In Costa Rica, it shines as an
  ornamental specimen and niche pulpwood species — a spectacular introduced
  complement to the country's extraordinary native tree diversity.
