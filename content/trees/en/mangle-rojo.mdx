### Common Names by Region

<DataTable
  headers={["Region/Language", "Common Name"]}
  rows={[
    ["English", "Red Mangrove, American Mangrove"],
    ["Spanish (Costa Rica)", "Mangle Rojo, Mangle Colorado"],
    ["Spanish (General)", "Mangle Tinto"],
    ["Portuguese (Brazil)", "Mangue Vermelho"],
    ["French", "Manglier Rouge"],
  ]}
/>

### Etymology

- **Rhizophora**: From Greek _rhiza_ (root) + _phoros_ (bearing), referring to the distinctive aerial prop roots
- **mangle**: Spanish word for mangrove, derived from Taino (indigenous Caribbean) _mangle_
- The "red" common name comes from the reddish color of the wood and tannin-rich bark

---

## Physical Description

### Tree Form

Red Mangrove is a distinctive evergreen tree reaching 20-30 meters in optimal conditions, though often smaller (8-12 m) in more exposed coastal sites. The most recognizable feature is the complex system of **prop roots** - arching aerial roots that descend from the trunk and lower branches into the water or mud, creating a tangled, stilt-like support structure. Trees often have multiple trunks emerging from a common base. The crown is relatively dense and rounded, with thick, leathery foliage.

### Bark

Bark is **smooth to slightly fissured**, gray-brown to reddish-brown on the outer surface. The inner bark is distinctly **reddish** and contains high concentrations of tannins. When cut, the wood oxidizes to a red color, giving the tree its common name. The bark has been traditionally used as a source of tannins for leather processing.

### Prop Root System

The prop roots are the tree's most distinctive feature:

- **Aerial origin**: Roots emerge from trunk and branches above water level
- **Arching growth**: Roots curve downward toward water/mud substrate
- **Anchoring**: Once established, roots provide stability in soft, shifting substrate
- **Gas exchange**: Lenticels (pores) on roots allow oxygen absorption in anaerobic mud
- **Buttressing**: Create a wide base for stability against waves and tides

### Leaves

  <PropertyCard icon="📏" label="Size" value="8-15 cm long, 4-6 cm wide" />
  <PropertyCard

  <PropertyCard
    icon="💧"
    label="Adaptation"
    value="Salt-excreting glands on underside"
  />
</PropertiesGrid>

Leaves are **thick and succulent**, adapted to conserve water in saline environments. The waxy cuticle reduces water loss. Small salt-excreting glands on the leaf underside help the tree manage salt intake.

### Flowers

Red Mangrove produces small, pale yellow flowers:

- **Size**: 2-3 cm across
- **Arrangement**: Clusters of 2-4 flowers
- **Petals**: 4 narrow petals, pale yellow to cream
- **Blooming**: April through August, with peak in May-June
- **Pollination**: Primarily wind-pollinated, some insect visitation

Flowers are not showy but are important for the unique reproductive strategy.

### Fruit & Propagules

Red Mangrove exhibits **vivipary** - the seed germinates while still attached to the parent tree:

- **Propagule**: Elongated, pencil-like structure 15-30 cm long
- **Color**: Green when developing, brown when mature
- **Development time**: 6-12 months on parent tree
- **Dispersal**: Propagules drop and can float for weeks, establishing when they reach suitable substrate
- **Establishment**: Propagule sticks into mud at low tide, rapidly developing roots

This adaptation allows the seedling to establish quickly in the challenging intertidal environment.

### Ecological Role

Red Mangrove plays a critical role in coastal ecosystems:

**Coastal Protection:**

- Dissipates wave energy, protecting shorelines from erosion
- Reduces storm surge impacts during hurricanes
- Stabilizes coastlines with extensive root system
- Traps sediment, building up coastal land

**Carbon Sequestration:**

- Mangrove forests are among the most efficient carbon sinks on Earth
- Store 3-5 times more carbon per hectare than tropical rainforests
- Carbon locked in both biomass and deep mud sediments
- Critical for climate change mitigation

**Water Quality:**

- Filters pollutants and excess nutrients from runoff
- Traps sediments before they reach coral reefs and seagrass beds
- Improves coastal water clarity

### Wildlife Associations

Red Mangrove forests support exceptional biodiversity:

  ]}
/>

**Nursery Ecosystem:**

- 75% of commercial fish species in tropics depend on mangroves during juvenile stages
- The prop root structure provides protection from predators
- Rich detrital food web supports invertebrates
- Critical link between terrestrial and marine ecosystems

### Adaptations to Saline Environment

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="Salt Management">

Red Mangrove employs multiple strategies to cope with high salinity:

1. **Salt exclusion**: Roots filter out up to 90% of salt from seawater
2. **Salt excretion**: Specialized glands on leaves excrete excess salt
3. **Salt accumulation**: Old leaves accumulate salt, then drop (deciduous in salt, not temperature)
4. **Osmotic adjustment**: High internal solute concentrations balance external salinity

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Waterlogged Soil Adaptation">

The anaerobic mud contains no oxygen for root respiration. Adaptations include:

1. **Lenticels**: Pores on prop roots for gas exchange with atmosphere
2. **Aerenchyma tissue**: Spongy tissue transports oxygen to submerged roots
3. **Prop root system**: Maximizes surface area for oxygen absorption above water

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Vivipary (Live-Bearing Seeds)">

Seeds germinate while attached to parent tree, producing a ready-to-establish propagule:

1. **Advantage**: Seedling already developed when it reaches substrate
2. **Buoyancy**: Propagules float horizontally for dispersal
3. **Establishment**: Upon grounding, propagule orients vertically and roots rapidly
4. **Timing**: Propagule can remain viable floating for months

## Growing Red Mangrove

<Callout type="warning">
  Red Mangrove requires very specific conditions - full saltwater or brackish
  water inundation in tidal zones. This is not a tree for typical landscaping.
  Growing information is primarily for restoration and conservation projects.
</Callout>

### Propagation

**From Propagules (Recommended):**

1. **Collection**: Harvest mature propagules (brown, 20-30 cm long) from parent trees
2. **Timing**: Collect when propagules naturally begin to drop (mature)
3. **Storage**: Can store in seawater for a few days if needed
4. **Viability**: Test by placing in water - viable propagules float horizontally
5. **Planting**: Plant immediately for best results

**Planting Technique:**

1. **Site selection**: Choose intertidal zone at proper elevation (regularly flooded by tides)
2. **Substrate**: Soft mud or sand-mud mix
3. **Depth**: Push propagule 10-15 cm into substrate
4. **Angle**: Plant vertically or at slight angle
5. **Spacing**: 2-3 m apart for restoration projects
6. **Timing**: Plant during calm weather, preferably during wet season
7. **Protection**: May need temporary fencing to prevent herbivory and wave damage

**Success Factors:**

- Proper elevation (tidal zone appropriate for red mangrove)
- Protection from strong wave action during establishment
- Good water quality (not heavily polluted)
- Monitoring and maintenance for first year
