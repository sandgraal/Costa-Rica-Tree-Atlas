### Taxonomic Notes

The species was described by Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck, a prominent 19th-century German botanist. The genus _Nectandra_ is one of the most diverse genera in the Lauraceae family, with approximately 114 species distributed throughout tropical and subtropical America. Many _Nectandra_ species are valued timber trees with aromatic wood properties.

The genus name comes from Greek _nektar_ (nectar) and _andros_ (male), referring to the nectar-secreting glands on the stamens. _Nectandra cissiflora_ is distinguished from related species by its larger leaves, pubescent young stems, and distinctive fruit structure.

### Etymology

- **Nectandra**: From Greek, referring to nectar-producing stamens characteristic of the genus
- **cissiflora**: From Latin _cissus_ (ivy) and _flora_ (flower), possibly referring to the clustered flower arrangement

## Physical/Botanical Description

### Tree Form

Sigua is a tall, semi-deciduous tree reaching 20-35 meters in height, occasionally taller in optimal conditions. The trunk is straight and cylindrical, typically 60-90 cm in diameter, free of branches for much of its length. The crown is relatively sparse and vase-shaped, composed of ascending branches. The tree may lose some leaves during the dry season, particularly in drier parts of its range.

### Bark

The bark is gray to gray-brown, relatively smooth on young trees, becoming slightly fissured and scaly with age. The outer bark is thin to moderately thick. Young stems are particularly distinctive, being densely covered with reddish-brown (rufous) hairs that gradually disappear as the stems mature. When cut, the bark and wood emit a strong, distinctive odor.

### Leaves

<PropertiesGrid>
  <PropertyCard icon="🍃" label="Arrangement" value="Alternate" />
  <PropertyCard icon="📏" label="Size" value="9-26 cm long, 5-10 cm wide" />
  <PropertyCard

    label="Texture"
    value="Pubescent beneath, smoother above"
  />
  <PropertyCard
    icon="🌿"
    label="Type"
    value="Simple, oblong-elliptic to oblanceolate"
  />
</PropertiesGrid>

The leaves are larger than those of the related _Nectandra salicina_ (Quizarrá), measuring 9-26 cm long and 5-10 cm wide. They are oblong-elliptic to oblanceolate (inverse lance-shaped) with an entire margin and acute to acuminate tip. The upper surface is dark green and relatively smooth at maturity, while the lower surface is paler and often covered with fine hairs (pubescent), especially along the veins.

Leaves are attached by short petioles. The venation is pinnate, with the midrib prominent on both surfaces. When crushed, the leaves emit a characteristic aromatic scent typical of the Lauraceae family, though less pronounced than the wood's odor.

### Flowers

<PropertiesGrid>
  <PropertyCard icon="🌸" label="Color" value="White to pale cream" />
  <PropertyCard icon="📏" label="Size" value="Small, 3-5 mm" />
  <PropertyCard
    icon="🌿"
    label="Arrangement"
    value="Axillary panicles (clusters)"
  />
  <PropertyCard icon="📅" label="Season" value="January-March" />
</PropertiesGrid>

The flowers are small and inconspicuous, typical of the Lauraceae family. They appear in axillary panicles (branched clusters) arising from leaf axils. Individual flowers are only 3-5 mm in diameter, with a tubular perianth composed of tepals (undifferentiated petals and sepals) that are white to pale cream in color.

Flowers are perfect (bisexual), with 9 stamens arranged in three whorls. The stamens have nectar-producing glands at their base, which attract small insects for pollination. Flowering occurs primarily in the dry season (January-March), when the trees produce numerous flower clusters.

### Fruit & Seeds

The fruit is a distinctive berry, approximately 1.5-2.5 cm long, ellipsoid to ovoid in shape. Immature fruits are green, becoming deep purple to nearly black when fully ripe. The fruit sits in a characteristic red or orange-red cupule (cup-like structure) at the base, which is a diagnostic feature of many _Nectandra_ species. This red dome remains on the peduncle after the fruit is removed by birds or falls.

Each fruit contains a single large seed. The fruits ripen primarily from May through July and are an important food source for birds and mammals, including toucans, parrots, monkeys, and other forest wildlife. The fleshy fruit pulp is consumed by animals, which then disperse the seeds throughout the forest.

## Growing Sigua

### Propagation

**From Seed**: Seeds must be collected from ripe fruits (deep purple) in May-July. The fleshy pulp should be removed, and seeds planted immediately, as they lose viability quickly and do not store well.

- **Collection**: Gather fruits directly from trees or from fresh-fallen fruits beneath parent trees
- **Processing**: Remove pulp by mashing and washing seeds
- **Sowing**: Plant in nursery beds or containers 1-2 cm deep in organic-rich potting mix
- **Germination**: Slow and irregular, typically taking 2-4 months; germination rates are often low (30-50%)
- **Seedling care**: Provide shade (50-70%) and consistent moisture; seedlings grow slowly initially

**Note**: Propagation from cuttings has not been well documented and is not a standard practice for this species.

### Site Selection

Choose sites that mimic natural rainforest conditions:

- **Climate**: Warm, humid tropical to premontane zones
- **Elevation**: Sea level to 1200 m optimal; up to 1500-2000 m possible
- **Rainfall**: Areas receiving 2500+ mm annual rainfall
- **Soil**: Deep, well-drained soils preferred; adapts to various soil types
- **Light**: Full sun for timber production; tolerates partial shade when young

### Planting

1. Plant at beginning of rainy season (May-June) for best establishment
2. Clear competing vegetation in 1-2 m radius around planting site
3. Dig hole larger than root ball
4. Plant at same depth as in nursery container
5. Water thoroughly after planting
6. Mulch around base to retain moisture and suppress weeds
7. Stake if necessary in exposed locations

### Spacing

- **Timber production**: 10-15 m spacing (44-100 trees/hectare)
- **Mixed reforestation**: Variable spacing in combination with other species
- **Landscape use**: 15-20 m from structures and other large trees

### Care Requirements

<PropertiesGrid>

  />
</PropertiesGrid>

**Watering**: Keep soil moist during establishment (first 1-2 years). Once established, trees are relatively drought-tolerant during short dry seasons.

**Fertilizing**: Generally not necessary if planted in good forest soil. In degraded sites, organic fertilizer or compost application during first 2-3 years may improve growth.

**Pruning**: For timber production, prune lower branches as tree grows to develop straight, clear trunk. Remove competing stems to maintain single leader.

**Weeding**: Critical during first 2-3 years; maintain weed-free zone around young trees.

### Common Growing Problems

1. **Low germination rates**: Solution - Collect abundant fresh seed, plant immediately, provide optimal nursery conditions
2. **Slow early growth**: Solution - Be patient; growth accelerates after establishment phase
3. **Competition from aggressive species**: Solution - Maintain weed control, consider planting in groups for mutual support
4. **Unsuitable for highland areas**: Solution - Only plant in appropriate elevation zones (below 1200-1500 m)

### Growth Expectations

- **First 2 years**: Slow establishment, 30-60 cm/year
- **Years 3-10**: Moderate growth, 60-100 cm/year
- **Years 10-25**: Continued vertical growth, crown development
- **Timber size**: 15-25 years depending on site quality and management
