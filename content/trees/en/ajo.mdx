toxicityDetails: "Ajo is non-toxic. The large nuts (seeds) are edible, nutritious, and have been consumed by indigenous peoples for centuries. The nuts are rich in protein and oil (similar to Brazil nuts). They can be eaten raw or roasted. No toxicity documented in humans or animals."
skinContactDetails: "No skin irritation. Safe to handle all parts of the tree."
structuralRiskDetails: "As one of Costa Rica's largest emergent rainforest trees (up to 50m tall), Ajo has massive buttress roots that can be 3-4 meters tall and extend 5+ meters from trunk. These roots can damage foundations, sidewalks, and underground utilities. Branches are extremely heavy and can cause serious damage or injury when falling. This is a tree for large forest settings, not residential yards. The crown is subject to wind damage in exposed locations."
safetyNotes: "Safe tree in terms of toxicity, but the massive size and structural features make it unsuitable for residential planting. Best for forest conservation and restoration projects. The tree is Endangered (EN) and protected under CITES - planting and conservation encouraged but should be in appropriate forest settings. Children can safely eat the nuts."
wildlifeRisks: "Safe for all wildlife and domestic animals. The nuts are an important food source for large animals including tapirs, peccaries, and spider monkeys."

# Ajo (Costa Rican Souari)

<Callout type="warning" title="Endangered Rainforest Giant">
  The **Ajo** (_Caryocar costaricense_), also called Ajillo or Costa Rican
  Souari, is one of the largest and most impressive trees in Costa Rica's
  lowland rainforests. Rising above the canopy on massive buttressed trunks,
  these emergent giants can reach 50 meters tall. Listed as **Endangered** by
  the IUCN and protected under **CITES Appendix II**, the Ajo faces ongoing
  threats from habitat loss and deforestation.

## Why This Tree Matters

### Cathedral of the Rainforest

The Ajo is what ecologists call an "emergent"—a tree that rises above the main forest canopy, standing alone against the sky like a living cathedral spire. These towering giants play crucial roles in rainforest ecosystems:

<TwoColumn>
<Column>

#### Ecological Importance

- **Habitat**: Crown provides nesting for raptors and other birds
- **Food source**: Nutritious seeds feed agoutis, peccaries, and other wildlife
- **Forest structure**: Creates vertical habitat diversity
- **Carbon storage**: Massive biomass stores significant carbon
- **Microclimate**: Influences temperature and humidity below

</Column>
<Column>

#### Cultural Significance

- **Traditional food**: Edible nuts harvested by indigenous peoples
- **Medicinal use**: Traditional remedies from various parts
- **Landmark**: Often used as reference points in forests
- **Spiritual**: Revered as sacred trees in some communities

</Column>

  The Caryocaraceae is a small family of just 2 genera and about 25 species,
  found in tropical Central and South America. They are known for their
  hard-shelled fruits containing edible seeds. The most famous relative is the
  Pequi (_Caryocar brasiliense_) of Brazil, whose spiny pulp is a culinary

## Ecological Relationships

### Wildlife Dependencies

<DataTable
  headers={["Animal", "Relationship", "Importance"]}
  rows={[
    ["Agoutis", "Seed disperser/predator", "Critical for regeneration"],

    ["Harpy Eagles", "Nesting habitat", "Use emergent crowns"],
    ["Bats", "Pollinator", "Nocturnal flower visitors"],
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="tip" title="Seed Dispersal Challenge">
  The Ajo's large, heavy seeds depend on large mammals like agoutis and
  peccaries for dispersal. As these animals decline due to hunting and habitat
  loss, the tree's ability to regenerate is compromised—a classic example of how
  species extinctions cascade through ecosystems.

<Callout type="warning" title="Protecting Forest Giants">
  The Ajo represents the majesty of Costa Rica's lowland rainforests—trees so
  large they create their own ecosystems, supporting countless species from
  their buttressed roots to their sky-high crowns. As these forests disappear,
  so too do these giants. Protecting primary rainforest isn't just about saving
  individual species—it's about preserving the architectural complexity that
  makes tropical forests the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth.
