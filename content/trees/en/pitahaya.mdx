# Pitahaya (Dragon Fruit)

<Callout type="success" title="Costa Rica's Native Dragon Fruit">
  The **Pitahaya** (_Hylocereus costaricensis_) is a climbing cactus native to
  Costa Rica that produces the famous Dragon Fruit. Unlike the more common
  Asian-cultivated varieties, Costa Rica's native pitahaya has deep magenta
  flesh and an intensely sweet flavor. This spectacular plant climbs trees in
  tropical forests, blooming at night with enormous fragrant flowers and
  producing fruits that look like something from a fantasy world—bright pink
  with green "dragon scales."

<AccordionItem title="🔬 Etymology & Taxonomic Notes">

The genus name **Hylocereus** derives from Greek:

- _hyle_ = "forest" or "wood"
- _cereus_ = "waxy" or "candle-like" (referring to cactus form)

The species epithet **costaricensis** simply means "from Costa Rica," honoring this as the species' homeland.

**Note**: Cactus taxonomy is actively debated. Some authorities place pitahayas in the genus _Selenicereus_, making this species _Selenicereus costaricensis_. The traditional _Hylocereus_ classification remains widely used.

## Ecological Role

### Natural Interactions

<DataTable
  headers={["Organism", "Role", "Interaction"]}
  rows={[
    ["Long-tongued bats", "Primary pollinator", "Night visits to flowers"],

<Callout type="leaf" title="Bat-Flower Partnership">
  The pitahaya's enormous night-blooming flowers are perfectly designed for bat
  pollination. The strong fragrance attracts nectar-feeding bats from long
  distances, and the flower's sturdy structure supports their weight while they
  feed. This ancient partnership means that healthy bat populations are
  essential for wild pitahaya reproduction.

## Commercial Importance

<Callout type="info" title="Export Potential">
  Dragon fruit is one of the fastest-growing tropical fruit exports worldwide. Costa Rica's native _H. costaricensis_ with its vibrant magenta flesh commands premium prices in international markets. The fruit's visual appeal and superfood status have driven increasing cultivation across the country.

**Market Advantages**:

- Striking appearance
- Superfood marketing potential
- Long shelf life (2-3 weeks)
- Increasing global demand

</Callout>

---

## Conservation

<Callout type="success" title="Conservation Status">
  **IUCN Status**: Least Concern (LC)

Wild populations of _Hylocereus costaricensis_ remain healthy throughout Costa Rica. Cultivation has actually increased the species' presence, with plants spreading from farms into adjacent areas.

**Considerations**:

- Wild populations depend on bat pollinators
- Forest fragmentation can reduce bat visits
- Maintaining habitat corridors benefits both
- Cultivation serves as de facto conservation
