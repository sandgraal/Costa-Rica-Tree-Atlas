# Pitahaya (Dragon Fruit)

<Callout type="success" title="Costa Rica's Native Dragon Fruit">
  The **Pitahaya** (_Hylocereus costaricensis_) is a climbing cactus native to
  Costa Rica that produces the famous Dragon Fruit. Unlike the more common
  Asian-cultivated varieties, Costa Rica's native pitahaya has deep magenta
  flesh and an intensely sweet flavor. This spectacular plant climbs trees in
  tropical forests, blooming at night with enormous fragrant flowers and
  producing fruits that look like something from a fantasy world—bright pink
  with green "dragon scales."

<Callout type="info" title="The Real Costa Rican Pitahaya">
  _Hylocereus costaricensis_ is the true native Costa Rican dragon fruit,
  distinguished by its deep magenta flesh. This species name literally means
  "from Costa Rica." While white-fleshed varieties dominate commercial
  production worldwide, the magenta-fleshed Costa Rican native is increasingly
  valued for its sweeter flavor and higher antioxidant content.

## Ecological Role

### Natural Interactions

<DataTable
  headers={["Organism", "Role", "Interaction"]}
  rows={[
    ["Long-tongued bats", "Primary pollinator", "Night visits to flowers"],
    ["Sphinx moths", "Secondary pollinator", "Night nectar feeding"],

    ["Birds", "Seed disperser", "Fruit consumption"],
    ["Host trees", "Support", "Climbing substrate"],
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="leaf" title="Bat-Flower Partnership">
  The pitahaya's enormous night-blooming flowers are perfectly designed for bat
  pollination. The strong fragrance attracts nectar-feeding bats from long
  distances, and the flower's sturdy structure supports their weight while they
  feed. This ancient partnership means that healthy bat populations are
  essential for wild pitahaya reproduction.

### Production System

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="🏗️ Trellising">
    Commercial pitahaya requires support: - **Post and ring**: Concrete posts
    with metal rings - **T-trellis**: Wooden posts with crossbars - **Live
    fence**: Traditional—on trees/fence posts - Plants train onto support, drape
    over top
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="🌱 Propagation">
    - **Cuttings**: Primary method, 30-50 cm stem pieces - Root directly in
    ground or pots - First fruit: 1-3 years from cutting - Seeds possible but
    slow and variable
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="🌸 Hand Pollination">

## Commercial Importance

<Callout type="info" title="Export Potential">
  Dragon fruit is one of the fastest-growing tropical fruit exports worldwide. Costa Rica's native _H. costaricensis_ with its vibrant magenta flesh commands premium prices in international markets. The fruit's visual appeal and superfood status have driven increasing cultivation across the country.

**Market Advantages**:

- Striking appearance
- Superfood marketing potential
- Long shelf life (2-3 weeks)
- Increasing global demand

</Callout>

---

## Conservation

<Callout type="success" title="Conservation Status">
  **IUCN Status**: Least Concern (LC)

Wild populations of _Hylocereus costaricensis_ remain healthy throughout Costa Rica. Cultivation has actually increased the species' presence, with plants spreading from farms into adjacent areas.

**Considerations**:

- Wild populations depend on bat pollinators
- Forest fragmentation can reduce bat visits
- Maintaining habitat corridors benefits both
- Cultivation serves as de facto conservation
