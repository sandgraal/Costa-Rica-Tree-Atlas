# Quina (Quinine Tree)

<Callout type="warning" title="Historic medicine, potent chemistry">
  **Quina** (_Cinchona pubescens_) is the classic **quinine tree**. Its bark
  produces quinine, the alkaloid that revolutionized malaria treatment and
  flavored tonic water. The same chemistry that makes it valuable also makes
  bark preparations **potent and potentially toxic** if misused.

<AccordionItem title="🔎 Taxonomic Notes">

- The genus **Cinchona** belongs to the coffee family (**Rubiaceae**) and is
  renowned for medicinal alkaloids in the bark.
- _C. pubescens_ is the principal cultivated species for quinine production in
  several tropical regions.
- Older horticultural literature may list cultivated forms under alternate
  cinchona species; modern floras recognize _C. pubescens_ as the accepted name.

## Physical & Botanical Description

**Growth Form**:

- Evergreen highland tree, typically **6-10 m** tall with a rounded crown.
- Bark gray-brown on the outside; inner bark turns reddish and is intensely
  bitter due to alkaloids.

**Leaves**:

- Opposite, **simple, leathery** leaves, usually **7-20 cm** long.
- Elliptic to oblong shape with soft hairs on the underside ("pubescent").

**Flowers**:

- **Pink, star-shaped** flowers in large terminal clusters.
- Fragrant and attractive to insects.

**Fruit & Seeds**:

- Dry **capsule** that splits to release many **wind-dispersed** seeds.
- Seed release is a key strategy for colonizing disturbed slopes.

### Native Range

_Quina_ is **native** to the northern Andes and parts of Central America,
including Costa Rica.

### Introduced & Cultivated Range

- Widely introduced to tropical regions for quinine production.
- Naturalized in some islands (notably the Galapagos), where it can be invasive.
- Cultivated in parts of East Africa and Southeast Asia for medicinal bark.

---

## Habitat & Ecology

- **Cloud-forest specialist** thriving in cool, humid montane climates.
- Prefers **misty slopes** with steady rainfall and well-drained volcanic soils.
- Flowers attract a range of **pollinating insects**.
- Seeds are light and wind-dispersed, aiding rapid colonization after
  disturbances.
- Outside its native range, it can **naturalize aggressively**, forming dense
  stands that shade out native understory plants.

  <PropertyCard
    icon="💊"
    label="Medicinal"
    value="Quinine and related alkaloids"

  <PropertyCard icon="🥤" label="Beverage" value="Flavoring for tonic water" />
  <PropertyCard

    label="Conservation"
    value="Research and restoration plantings"
  />
</PropertiesGrid>

### Medicinal Bark

The bark is a historical source of **quinine**, a compound that became the
first effective treatment for malaria. Extracts are powerful and must be used
with caution due to toxicity at high doses.

### Culinary & Beverage Uses

Quinine's bitter flavor is the signature taste of **tonic water** and some
bitters.

### Ornamental & Educational Plantings

Because of its attractive flowers and historic importance, quina is sometimes
planted in botanical gardens and educational forests.

---

## Cultural & Historical Significance

- Andean Indigenous knowledge identified quinine bark as a fever remedy long
  before it entered European medicine.
- The genus name honors the **Countess of Chinchon**, associated with the early
  spread of quinine to Europe.
- **National tree of Peru and Ecuador**, symbolizing the botanical heritage of
  the Andes.

---

## Conservation Status

<ConservationStatusBox status="LC" statusText="Least Concern" />

### Assessment Summary

- Listed as **Least Concern** due to broad native distribution and continued
  cultivation.
- Local populations can still be threatened by **habitat conversion** or
  overharvest of bark.

### Management Notes

- Sustainable bark harvest (small strips, rotational harvesting) helps avoid
  killing trees.
- Avoid planting in sensitive island ecosystems where it may become invasive.

  <PropertyCard
    icon="🌱"
    label="Seeds"
    value="Primary method; tiny, wind-dispersed"
  />
  <PropertyCard
    icon="🪴"

  <PropertyCard
    icon="🕒"
    label="Germination"
    value="2-4 weeks in warm, humid conditions"
  />
</PropertiesGrid>

### Site Requirements

- **Light**: Partial shade when young; brighter light as it matures.
- **Moisture**: Consistent humidity and regular rainfall.
- **Soils**: Deep, well-drained loams or volcanic soils.

### Care Tips

- Mulch heavily to mimic cloud-forest leaf litter.
- Protect young trees from strong winds and lowland heat.
- Prune lightly; avoid heavy bark removal without a management plan.

## Where to See Quina in Costa Rica

- Look for cultivated specimens in **high-elevation botanical gardens** and
  **cloud-forest reserves**.
- Most likely in montane areas of the **Central Volcanic Range** and
  **Talamanca** regions.
