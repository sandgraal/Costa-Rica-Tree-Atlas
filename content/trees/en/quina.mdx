# Quina (Quinine Tree)

<Callout type="warning" title="Historic medicine, potent chemistry">
  **Quina** (_Cinchona pubescens_) is the classic **quinine tree**. Its bark
  produces quinine, the alkaloid that revolutionized malaria treatment and
  flavored tonic water. The same chemistry that makes it valuable also makes
  bark preparations **potent and potentially toxic** if misused.

</PropertiesGrid>

### Medicinal Bark

The bark is a historical source of **quinine**, a compound that became the
first effective treatment for malaria. Extracts are powerful and must be used
with caution due to toxicity at high doses.

### Culinary & Beverage Uses

Quinine's bitter flavor is the signature taste of **tonic water** and some
bitters.

### Ornamental & Educational Plantings

Because of its attractive flowers and historic importance, quina is sometimes
planted in botanical gardens and educational forests.

---

## Cultural & Historical Significance

- Andean Indigenous knowledge identified quinine bark as a fever remedy long
  before it entered European medicine.
- The genus name honors the **Countess of Chinchon**, associated with the early
  spread of quinine to Europe.
- **National tree of Peru and Ecuador**, symbolizing the botanical heritage of
  the Andes.

---

## Conservation Status

<ConservationStatusBox status="LC" statusText="Least Concern" />

### Assessment Summary

- Listed as **Least Concern** due to broad native distribution and continued
  cultivation.
- Local populations can still be threatened by **habitat conversion** or
  overharvest of bark.

### Management Notes

- Sustainable bark harvest (small strips, rotational harvesting) helps avoid
  killing trees.
- Avoid planting in sensitive island ecosystems where it may become invasive.

## Sustainable Bark Stewardship

<Callout type="warning" title="Do not ring-bark quina">
  Removing bark all around the trunk interrupts cambium flow and usually kills
  the tree. Any bark use must be rotational, partial, and tied to legal
  management plans.
</Callout>

### Practical Harvest Principles

1. Harvest only from mature trees with trunk diameter greater than 20 cm.
2. Remove narrow vertical strips rather than broad panels.
3. Leave at least 70-80% of bark intact per harvest cycle.
4. Rotate harvest faces and allow multi-year recovery before revisiting the same
   side.
5. Suspend harvest when drought stress, pest pressure, or canopy dieback is
   observed.

### Community and Legal Considerations

- Prioritize cultivated or managed quina sources instead of wild extraction.
- Coordinate with local conservation authorities in protected montane zones.
- Record each harvest event with date, tree ID, and bark volume removed.
- Pair bark-use projects with enrichment planting to maintain population
  structure.

## Field Identification Checklist

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="1) Start with habitat">

- High-elevation, humid, montane forest edge or cloud-forest interior.
- Cool nights and persistent mist strongly favor quina occurrence.
- Stands in open, hot lowland sites are usually other Rubiaceae taxa.

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="2) Confirm bark and leaves">

- Gray-brown outer bark with notably bitter inner bark.
- Opposite, leathery leaves with pubescence on the underside.
- Elliptic to oblong blade form, usually with a pale lower surface.

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="3) Verify flowers and fruit">

- Terminal clusters of pink, star-like flowers during bloom.
- Dry capsules that split open to release many winged seeds.
- Fruiting branches often retain diagnostic capsule remnants.

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="4) Cross-check with local records">

- Compare field notes against iNaturalist observations in the same elevation
  band.
- When in doubt, document leaves, flowers, and bark together for expert review.
- Use herbarium confirmation for restoration or medicinal supply projects.
