Just 1-2 seeds can kill a child; 8-10 seeds can kill an adult. Causes severe cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat), nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and death from cardiac arrest. Also contains cerberin, a highly toxic compound. Leaves, flowers, and sap are also poisonous. This is one of the most common causes of plant poisoning deaths in tropical regions. Often mistaken for edible nuts."
skinContactDetails: "Sap can cause mild skin irritation in some individuals. Handling the plant generally safe if parts are not eaten. However, wash hands thoroughly after contact and avoid touching eyes or mouth."
allergenDetails: "Some individuals may experience mild allergic reactions to pollen or sap. Generally low allergen risk compared to toxicity risk."
safetyNotes: "This beautiful ornamental is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS and responsible for numerous deaths worldwide. Seeds are the primary danger—children mistake them for edible nuts. Common in landscaping throughout Costa Rica, often planted in schools, parks, and residential areas without adequate warning. Should NOT be planted where children have access. All plant parts toxic if ingested. Keep fallen seeds away from children and pets. Symptoms appear within 1-6 hours: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, irregular heartbeat, confusion, seizures, death. If ingestion suspected, seek emergency medical care IMMEDIATELY—this is life-threatening and requires cardiac monitoring."
wildlifeRisks: "Highly toxic to all domestic animals including dogs, cats, horses, cattle, and birds. Even small amounts can be fatal. Seeds, leaves, and flowers all pose danger. Keep all pets away from this plant."

<AccordionItem title="🔬 Taxonomic Notes">

The species was originally described as _Cerbera thevetia_ by Linnaeus in 1753, honoring André Thevet, a 16th-century French Franciscan friar and explorer who documented the plant during his travels in Brazil. The genus _Thevetia_ was later established by Linnaeus in 1758.

**Synonym**: _Cascabela thevetia_ (L.) Lippold — some modern taxonomists place this species in the genus _Cascabela_ based on molecular phylogenetics. Both names remain in active use.

**Related Species**: The closely related _Thevetia ahouai_ (Bushy Yellow Oleander) is also found in Costa Rica. The family Apocynaceae includes many toxic members: common oleander (_Nerium oleander_), frangipani (_Plumeria_), and the notorious _Cerbera manghas_ (Suicide Tree of southern Asia).

**Classification Note**: Despite the common name "oleander," _Thevetia peruviana_ is only distantly related to the true oleander _Nerium oleander_, though both are in the family Apocynaceae and both produce cardiac glycosides.

## Why Is This Plant So Dangerous?

### The "Lucky Nut" Tragedy

The seeds are responsible for most poisonings:

- **Appearance**: Triangular, compressed, resemble almonds or cashews
- **Name**: Called "lucky nuts" — ironically deadly
- **Size**: 2-3 cm long, hard outer shell
- **Fatal Dose**: 1-2 seeds can kill a child; 8-10 seeds can kill an adult
- **Accumulation**: Seeds fall and pile up under plants for months
- **Attraction**: Children and uninformed adults mistake them for edible nuts

### Cardiac Glycosides

Contains powerful heart toxins that work like uncontrolled heart medication:

- **Thevetin A & B**: The most abundant cardiac glycosides — primary toxic compounds
- **Peruvoside**: Another cardiac glycoside — studied as potential cardiac drug
- **Neriifolin**: Heart-affecting compound shared with related species
- **Cerberin**: Highly toxic alkaloid also found in the "Suicide Tree" (_Cerbera manghas_)
- **Mechanism**: All compounds inhibit the sodium-potassium ATPase pump in heart muscle cells, forcing the heart into irregular, dangerous rhythms that can cause cardiac arrest

### A Global Public Health Problem

Yellow Oleander poisoning is a significant worldwide issue:

- **Leading Cause**: One of the top causes of plant poisoning deaths in tropical regions
- **Sri Lanka**: Accounts for over 50% of plant poisoning hospital admissions
- **India**: Major cause of deliberate self-harm using plant toxins
- **Children**: Most vulnerable group due to the seed's nut-like appearance
- **Accidental**: Commonly mistaken for edible plants by tourists and newcomers to tropical areas

- **Persistence**: Evergreen — retains leaves year-round
- **Distinguishing feature**: Leaves release milky latex when broken, distinguishing from similar-looking plants

### Flowers

- **Color**: Bright yellow, sometimes peachy-yellow or apricot; pink or white cultivars also exist
- **Shape**: Funnel-shaped (infundibuliform), 5-lobed
- **Size**: 6-8 cm long, 4-5 cm across
- **Fragrance**: Sweetly scented, particularly in the evening
- **Arrangement**: Terminal or axillary cymes, usually 2-5 flowers per cluster
- **Season**: Blooms year-round in the tropics, with peaks during rainy season
- **Pollination**: Insects, particularly moths attracted to evening fragrance

### Fruit and Seeds

- **Fruit type**: Fleshy drupe, 3-5 cm diameter
- **Fruit color**: Green, turning yellow-brown to black when ripe
- **Shape**: Rounded to triangular, somewhat compressed
- **Seeds**: 1-2 per fruit, triangular, compressed, with a hard outer shell
- **Seed color**: Yellow-brown to grayish when dry
- **Resemblance**: Seeds closely resemble almonds or cashews — **this is the primary danger**
- **Persistence**: Seeds remain toxic even when dried, and can remain viable in soil for months
- **Dispersal**: Falls below parent plant; also spread by water (floats)

### Milky Sap

- **Type**: White milky latex (abundant)
- **Present in**: All parts — stems, leaves, flowers, roots
- **Exuded**: Immediately when any part is broken or cut
- **Content**: Contains cardiac glycosides at lower concentrations than seeds
- **Skin effect**: Can cause mild irritation; latex is sticky and difficult to remove

</PropertiesGrid>

### Why It's So Common

Despite extreme toxicity, Yellow Oleander is one of the most widely planted ornamentals in the tropics because:

- **Drought Tolerance**: Survives extended dry periods with minimal watering — ideal for Guanacaste's dry season
- **Low Maintenance**: Requires almost no care after establishment
- **Fast Growth**: From seed to flowering shrub in 2-3 years
- **Continuous Bloom**: Produces showy flowers year-round
- **Soil Tolerance**: Grows in poor, rocky, sandy, or alkaline soils
- **Salt Tolerance**: Moderate resistance to coastal salt spray
- **Pest Resistance**: Few pests or diseases — the toxins protect the plant
- **Heat Tolerance**: Thrives in full tropical sun

### Ecological Role

As an introduced species, Yellow Oleander has a limited but notable ecological role:

- **Pollinator Resource**: Flowers provide nectar for butterflies, hawk moths, and other pollinators
- **No Native Herbivores**: Virtually no animals in Costa Rica feed on this toxic plant
- **Invasive Potential**: Can naturalize along roadsides and disturbed areas in some tropical regions, though not typically considered highly invasive in Costa Rica
- **Soil Stabilization**: Root system helps prevent erosion on slopes and embankments

### How Cardiac Glycosides Kill

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="💊 Mechanism of Action">

Cardiac glycosides work by binding to and inhibiting the **sodium-potassium ATPase pump** (Na+/K+-ATPase) in heart muscle cells. This is the same mechanism as the pharmaceutical drug digoxin, but at uncontrolled, toxic doses:

1. **Ion Imbalance**: Inhibiting the pump raises intracellular sodium, which in turn increases intracellular calcium via the sodium-calcium exchanger
2. **Increased Contractility**: Excess calcium initially causes stronger heart contractions (positive inotropic effect)
3. **Electrical Instability**: As calcium levels continue to rise, the heart's electrical conduction system becomes unstable
4. **Arrhythmias**: The heart develops dangerous irregular rhythms — bradycardia (too slow), tachycardia (too fast), or chaotic rhythms
5. **Cardiac Arrest**: Without treatment, the heart may stop entirely

**Why it's so dangerous**: Unlike pharmaceutical digoxin, which is carefully dosed under medical supervision, eating plant material delivers an uncontrolled dose that can rapidly reach lethal levels.

## First Aid & Emergency Response

<Callout type="danger" title="⚠️ Emergency Numbers">

- **Costa Rica Emergency**: 911
- **Costa Rica Poison Control**: 2223-1028
- **INS Emergency**: 800-8000-911

</Callout>

### If Seeds or Plant Parts Are Eaten

1. **CALL EMERGENCY IMMEDIATELY**: 911
2. **Costa Rica Poison Control**: 2223-1028
3. **DO NOT WAIT** for symptoms to appear — poisoning is time-sensitive
4. **DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING** (vomiting can trigger vagal response and worsen cardiac arrhythmias)
5. If person is conscious and can swallow:
   - Give activated charcoal if available (within 1-2 hours of ingestion)
   - Give water or milk to dilute
6. **GET TO HOSPITAL IMMEDIATELY** — this is a cardiac emergency
7. Monitor pulse and breathing while waiting for emergency services
8. Bring sample of plant or seeds for identification

### Critical Information for Medical Team

Provide as much of this information as possible:

- Sample of plant or seeds (for positive identification)
- Exact or estimated time of ingestion
- Approximate amount consumed (number of seeds, leaves, etc.)
- Patient's weight and age (especially critical for children)
- Current symptoms and time of symptom onset
- Any pre-existing heart conditions or medications

### Hospital Treatment Protocol

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="🏥 What Medical Teams Will Do">

- **Cardiac monitoring**: Continuous ECG to detect arrhythmias (maintain for minimum 24-48 hours)
- **Activated charcoal**: If administered within 1-2 hours of ingestion; multi-dose activated charcoal may be used due to enterohepatic recirculation
- **IV fluids**: To maintain blood pressure and support circulation
- **Atropine**: For symptomatic bradycardia (slow heart rate)
- **Antiarrhythmic drugs**: Lidocaine or phenytoin for ventricular arrhythmias (avoid Class IA drugs)
- **Digoxin-specific Fab fragments (DigiFab)**: The definitive antidote — antibody fragments that bind and neutralize cardiac glycosides. Highly effective but may not be available in all hospitals
- **Electrolyte management**: Monitor and correct potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels
- **Temporary pacing**: May be required for severe heart block not responsive to atropine
- **ICU admission**: Severe cases require intensive care unit monitoring

- **Pharmaceutical Research**: Thevetin and peruvoside are being studied as potential controlled-dose cardiac medications
- **Anti-Cancer Properties**: Some cardiac glycosides from _Thevetia_ show promising anti-tumor activity in laboratory studies
- **Biofuel**: Seed oil is being investigated as a potential biodiesel feedstock — the plant's hardiness and low water requirements make it attractive for this purpose
- **Biopesticide**: Extracts are being studied as eco-friendly alternatives to synthetic insecticides

## Cultural & Historical Significance

### Discovery and Naming

The plant's scientific history reflects colonial-era exploration of the Americas:

- **André Thevet (1502-1590)**: French Franciscan friar and royal cosmographer who documented the plant during his 1555-1556 travels in Brazil. The genus _Thevetia_ honors his contributions
- **Linnaeus (1753)**: Initially described the plant as _Cerbera thevetia_ — the genus _Cerbera_ references Cerberus, the multi-headed dog guarding the underworld in Greek mythology, alluding to the plant's deadly nature
- **Colonial Documentation**: European naturalists quickly noted both the plant's beauty and extreme danger in their catalogues of New World flora

### The "Lucky Nut" Paradox

The common name "Lucky Nut" is deeply ironic:

- **Origin**: In some Caribbean and Latin American cultures, the dried seeds were carried as lucky charms
- **Shape**: The distinctive triangular seeds were considered unusual and attractive
- **Charm**: Seeds were strung as bracelets or carried in pockets for good luck
- **Tragic Irony**: The seeds most commonly handled as talismans are precisely the most toxic part of the plant
- **Modern Warning**: Health organizations now discourage the practice of carrying or handling seeds

### In Costa Rica

- **Ubiquitous Ornamental**: Planted throughout the country since at least the early 20th century
- **Name Variants**: Known locally as "chirca," "chirca amarilla," or "codo de fraile"
- **Growing Awareness**: Costa Rican poison control centers have increased public education efforts
- **Schools Issue**: The practice of planting Yellow Oleander in schoolyards is increasingly being questioned and reversed

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

### Should It Be Restricted?

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="📋 Arguments for Restriction">

- **Extremely toxic**: One of the most common causes of fatal plant poisoning in tropical regions
- **Children at risk**: Seeds resemble edible nuts and are left exposed on the ground
- **Planted near children**: Often found in schools, parks, and playgrounds without warnings
- **Many safer alternatives**: Numerous non-toxic yellow-flowering plants available
- **High poisoning rate**: Significant source of emergency room admissions in some countries
- **Precedent**: Some institutions and jurisdictions have already banned it from children's facilities

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="📋 Arguments Against Restriction">

- **Personal property rights**: Individuals should choose their own garden plants
- **Already widespread**: Removing all specimens would be impractical and expensive
- **Education may suffice**: Informed gardeners can manage the risk
- **Ecological value**: Provides pollinator resources and erosion control
- **Cultural significance**: Long history as ornamental in Latin America

</AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

### Current Status in Costa Rica

- No nationwide ban on planting Yellow Oleander
- Public health education increasingly focuses on plant poisoning awareness
- Some schools and institutions have voluntarily removed specimens
- Poison control centers (2223-1028) actively track Yellow Oleander cases
- No legal requirement for warning signs on private property

## Medical Significance

### Epidemiology

Yellow Oleander poisoning is a significant public health issue in tropical regions:

- **Sri Lanka**: Over 50% of all plant-poisoning hospital admissions involve _Thevetia peruviana_; accounts for thousands of cases annually
- **India**: Major cause of plant-related poisoning, particularly in southern states
- **Central America**: Pediatric poisonings are the primary concern, mostly accidental
- **Costa Rica**: Cases are tracked by poison control but comprehensive epidemiological data is limited

### Treatment Advances

- **Digoxin-specific Fab Fragments (DigiFab)**: The most effective antidote, originally developed for digoxin overdose but effective against all cardiac glycosides. A randomized trial in Sri Lanka showed 46% reduction in mortality when used for oleander poisoning
- **Activated Charcoal**: Multi-dose activated charcoal reduces cardiac glycoside absorption and enterohepatic recirculation
- **Detection**: Blood tests can measure cardiac glycoside levels using digoxin immunoassay (cross-reactivity allows detection)
- **Prognosis**: With early treatment and cardiac monitoring, survival rates exceed 90%; without treatment, mortality can exceed 50%

## Cultivation & Safe Management

Yellow oleander is widely planted as an ornamental for its year-round flowering. Safe management requires strict awareness of its extreme toxicity — all parts are lethal if ingested.

### Propagation

- **Seeds**: Collect mature drupes (black, globe-shaped); remove fleshy outer layer. Sow 2 cm deep in moist, well-drained potting mix. Germination in 2–4 weeks at 25–30 °C. **Wear gloves** — seeds are the most toxic part
- **Stem cuttings**: 20–30 cm semi-hardwood cuttings taken in early wet season root readily in sand/perlite under partial shade; rooting hormone not required. Wear nitrile gloves when cutting; sap causes skin irritation
- **Air layering**: Girdle a branch, wrap with moist sphagnum moss and plastic; roots form in 6–8 weeks. This method produces larger transplants quickly

<Callout type="danger" title="⚠️ CRITICAL PLACEMENT RULES">
  **NEVER plant Yellow Oleander where children or pets have access.** Do not
  plant near schools, playgrounds, livestock pens, or food gardens. All plant
  parts — flowers, leaves, sap, seeds — contain lethal cardiac glycosides. A
  single seed can kill a child. Site selection is as much a safety decision as a
  horticultural one.
</Callout>

### Maintenance

- **Watering**: Drought-tolerant once established (1–2 years). Water deeply every 2 weeks during establishment; reduce to monthly or rainfall-only afterward
- **Fertilisation**: Apply balanced slow-release fertiliser (10-10-10) twice yearly (beginning and end of wet season) at 100 g per tree for optimal flowering
- **Pruning**: Responds well to hard pruning for hedge formation. Prune after main flowering flush to shape. **ALWAYS wear nitrile gloves and eye protection** — sap is caustic and toxic. Bag and seal all clippings for disposal; never burn
- **Pest management**: Very few pest or disease problems. Occasionally affected by oleander caterpillar (Syntomeida epilais) — handpick wearing gloves; avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm pollinators

### Companion Planting

### Removal & Disposal

If a Yellow Oleander must be removed (e.g., new proximity to children's play area):

- **PPE required**: Nitrile gloves, sealed eye protection, long sleeves, respiratory protection during chipping
- **Do NOT burn**: Smoke contains volatile cardiac glycosides that cause severe respiratory distress
- **Root removal**: Extract completely — root fragments can resprout; remaining root pieces in soil retain toxicity
- **Disposal**: Bag all material in sealed heavy-duty waste bags; dispose through municipal green waste (not home composting)
- **Tool cleaning**: Wash all tools thoroughly with soap and water; sap residue remains toxic when dried
