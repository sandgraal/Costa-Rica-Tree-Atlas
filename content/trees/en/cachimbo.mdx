## Physical Description

### Tree Form

Cachimbo is a true emergent species, towering 45-60 meters above the forest canopy. The tree develops a straight, cylindrical trunk reaching diameters of 1 meter or more, with the first branches often 25-35 meters above ground. Most distinctive are the massive buttress roots extending 7-8 meters up the trunk, creating dramatic flying buttresses that anchor this giant in shallow tropical soils.

The crown is rounded and spreading, emerging above surrounding canopy trees to capture full sunlight. As a deciduous species, Cachimbo sheds most of its leaves before flowering, creating a spectacular display when the bare branches burst into pink blooms.

### Bark Characteristics

- **Color**: Grayish-brown to dark gray
- **Texture**: Moderately smooth when young, becoming slightly fissured with age
- **Features**: Vertical striations; may develop shallow furrows on old trees
- **Lenticels**: Present but not prominent
- **Inner Bark**: Reddish-brown; fibrous

### Leaves

- **Type**: Simple, alternate, spirally arranged
- **Shape**: Elliptical to oblong
- **Size**: 10-20 cm long, 4-8 cm wide
- **Texture**: Leathery (coriaceous)
- **Upper Surface**: Shiny dark green when mature
- **Lower Surface**: Pubescent (fine hairs), paler green
- **Margins**: Entire (smooth)
- **Petiole**: 1-2 cm long
- **Deciduous**: Sheds leaves before flowering season

### Flowers

- **Color**: Pink to pale magenta
- **Structure**: Bisexual, with numerous stamens
- **Arrangement**: Clustered along branches
- **Size**: 2-3 cm diameter
- **Pollination**: Primarily by beetles and large bees
- **Timing**: February-April (dry season), on leafless branches
- **Spectacle**: The bare-branched flowering creates a dramatic pink cloud effect visible across the forest

### Fruit & Seeds

- **Type**: Large woody capsule (pixidium)
- **Shape**: Cylindrical to barrel-shaped
- **Size**: 10-15 cm long, 5-8 cm diameter
- **Opening**: Dehiscent - the top "cap" falls off when mature
- **Seeds per Fruit**: 20-40 winged seeds
- **Seed Size**: 2-3 cm including wing
- **Aril**: White, fleshy, edible by wildlife
- **Dispersal**: Wind-dispersed seeds; animals eat arils and scatter seeds
- **Timing**: May-August

---

/>

### Ecological Role

**Emergent Canopy Structure**: As one of the tallest trees in the rainforest, Cachimbo creates critical structural diversity, providing unique habitat in the emergent layer above the main canopy. This uppermost layer experiences different temperature, humidity, and light conditions than the canopy below.

**Wildlife Food Source**: The white arils surrounding the seeds are consumed by numerous bird species, primates, and other arboreal mammals. The timing of fruit production (May-August) provides food during a critical period in the rainforest yearly cycle.

**Nesting and Perch Sites**: The massive crown and bare upper branches provide nesting sites for large birds including raptors, toucans, and parrots. The emergent position makes it valuable as a lookout perch for hawks and vultures.

**Seed Dispersal**: The winged seeds are wind-dispersed, but the fleshy arils attract animals that carry seeds to new locations, creating a dual dispersal strategy.

### Wildlife Associations

- **Birds**: Toucans, parrots, raptors use crown for nesting and perching
- **Mammals**: Howler monkeys, spider monkeys, kinkajous feed on seed arils
- **Insects**: Beetles and large bees are primary pollinators; wood-boring beetles use dead wood
- **Epiphytes**: Massive branches support orchids, bromeliads, and ferns

### Special Adaptations

**Massive Buttresses**: The flying buttress roots (7-8 m high) provide structural support in shallow tropical soils, distributing the tree's enormous weight and stabilizing it against strong winds.

**Deciduous Leaf Drop**: Shedding leaves before flowering conserves resources and makes the pink blooms more visible to pollinators flying above the canopy.

**Emergent Strategy**: Growing 10-20 meters above surrounding trees allows Cachimbo to monopolize sunlight while reducing competition, though it requires massive investment in trunk structure.

**Beetle Pollination**: Pink flowers adapted for beetle pollination are unusual in emergent trees and represent an evolutionary strategy to ensure pollination by abundant forest-floor insects that venture to the canopy.

---

## Cultural Significance

### Indigenous Knowledge

Cachimbo has been known to indigenous peoples of Central and South America for millennia. The tree's distinctive appearance - towering above all others with massive buttresses - made it a landmark in rainforest navigation. Indigenous communities recognized its value for wildlife, noting that animals would gather at fruiting trees.

The medicinal use of the bark for fever reduction is an ancient practice passed through generations of forest dwellers. The inner bark would be carefully harvested without girdling the tree, demonstrating sustainable use practices.

### Modern Conservation

**Vulnerable Status**: Cachimbo's listing as Vulnerable by IUCN highlights the threat from unsustainable logging. Its slow growth rate and requirement for primary forest conditions make populations difficult to restore once depleted.

**Reforestation Efforts**: Costa Rican conservation organizations increasingly recognize Cachimbo as important for forest restoration. However, the tree's slow growth and requirement for intact forest ecosystems mean it only succeeds in later stages of succession, after pioneer species have prepared the site.

**Ecotourism Value**: The spectacular flowering of leafless pink-bloomed giants emerging above the canopy attracts nature tourists and photographers to Costa Rican rainforests.

## Cultivation & Care

### Growing Requirements

**Climate**: Strictly tropical - requires year-round warmth (minimum 20°C), high humidity (80%+), and abundant rainfall (2000-3000 mm annually). Will not survive even brief cold snaps below 15°C.

**Site Selection**: Only suitable for tropical lowland reforestation in areas with existing or recovering rainforest. Not appropriate for:

- Urban or suburban landscapes
- Coffee or shade plantations (too large)
- Windbreaks (requires intact forest)
- Areas subject to flooding or waterlogging

**Soil**: Adaptable to various tropical soils (alluvial, sandy, clayey) but requires:

- Good drainage (will not tolerate waterlogging)
- Depth of at least 1 meter for root development
- Acidic to slightly acidic pH (4.5-6.5)
- Reasonable organic matter content

### Propagation

**Seed Collection**:

- Collect capsules as they begin to dehisce (cap loosening)
- Extract seeds with white arils attached
- Seeds viable for only 2-3 months - plant promptly
- Germination rate 60-80% with fresh seeds

**Germination**:

- Sow seeds in well-draining seedling mix
- Light shade initially, gradually increase to filtered light
- Keep consistently moist but not waterlogged
- Germination begins in 3-6 weeks
- Growth is slow initially (15-30 cm first year)

**Nursery Care**:

- Transplant seedlings to larger containers after 6 months
- Maintain in partial shade for first year
- Harden off gradually before outplanting
- Outplant when 50-80 cm tall (12-18 months)

### Planting

**Timing**: Beginning of rainy season (May-June on Pacific slope; flexible on Caribbean slope)

**Site Preparation**:

- Clear competing vegetation in 2-meter radius
- Dig hole 2x the root ball size
- Amend with compost only if soil is severely degraded
- Do not fertilize - tree adapted to low-nutrient tropical soils

**Spacing**:

- Reforestation: 10-15 meters from other large trees
- Allow 20+ meters from buildings, roads, power lines
- Consider eventual massive size and crown spread

**Establishment**:

- Water weekly during dry periods in first year
- Mulch 5-10 cm deep around base (keep away from trunk)
- Protect from cattle, deer, and other browsers
- Monitor for competing vines and vegetation

### Maintenance

**Year 1-3**:

- Clear competing vegetation 2-3 times per year
- Protect from browsing with fencing if necessary
- Water during extended dry periods
- Monitor for pest damage (rare but check for wood-boring beetles)

**Year 4-10**:

- Reduce vegetation clearing to once per year
- Tree should establish independence from maintenance
- Monitor health and growth rate
- Allow natural buttress development

**Mature Tree**:

- No maintenance required in natural forest setting
- Do not attempt to prune or shape - let grow naturally
- Allow massive buttresses to develop undisturbed
- Monitor for safety hazards near trails or buildings

**Never**:

- Do not fertilize (adapted to low-nutrient soils)
- Do not prune buttress roots or main trunk
- Do not plant in areas with infrastructure
- Do not attempt to grow outside tropical rainforest conditions
