### Image Requirements

For this project, you need:

| Image    | Filename           | Description                                |
| -------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Featured | `pilon.jpg`        | Hero image - full tree or impressive trunk |
| Bark     | `pilon-bark.jpg`   | Close-up of the gray-brown fissured bark   |
| Leaves   | `pilon-leaves.jpg` | Showing simple, alternate, leathery leaves |
| Wood     | `pilon-wood.jpg`   | Cut lumber showing the pink-to-brown color |

### Image Specifications

- **Format**: JPG or WebP preferred
- **Size**: At least 1200px wide for featured images
- **Aspect ratio**: 16:9 for featured, square for gallery
- **Location**: `/public/images/trees/`

### How to Add Images

1. Download images with appropriate licenses
2. Resize/optimize for web
3. Place in `/public/images/trees/`
4. Images will automatically appear in the tree pages

### Creating Your Own Images

If you're in Costa Rica, consider photographing:

1. **Full tree** - Show the height and form
2. **Trunk/bark** - Close-up texture
3. **Leaves** - Individual leaf and branch arrangement
4. **Cut wood** - Cross-section and grain pattern
5. **Wood aging** - Fresh vs aged color comparison
6. **Applications** - Furniture, flooring, or structural uses

### AI Image Generation Options

While I cannot generate images, you can use:

1. **DALL-E** (OpenAI) - Good for botanical illustrations
2. **Midjourney** - Excellent for realistic tree renders
3. **Stable Diffusion** - Free/open source option

**Suggested prompts**:

- "Hyeronima alchorneoides tree in Costa Rican rainforest, full tree view, professional nature photography"
- "Close-up of tropical hardwood bark texture, gray-brown fissured surface, macro photography"
- "Pilón wood grain, reddish-brown hardwood, furniture grade lumber, studio lighting"

### License Considerations

For a public project, prefer:

- **CC0** (Public Domain) - No restrictions
- **CC BY** - Attribution required
- **CC BY-SA** - Attribution + share alike
- **Unsplash License** - Free for commercial use

Avoid:

- **CC BY-NC** for commercial projects
- **All Rights Reserved** without permission

### Placeholder Solution

Until you have real images, the site displays:

- Gradient placeholder with tree icon
- Components still render beautifully without images

## Other Trees (Future Reference)

When adding new trees, follow the same pattern:

- `/public/images/trees/[slug].jpg` - Featured image
- `/public/images/trees/[slug]-bark.jpg` - Bark detail
- `/public/images/trees/[slug]-leaves.jpg` - Foliage
- `/public/images/trees/[slug]-wood.jpg` - Lumber/grain
