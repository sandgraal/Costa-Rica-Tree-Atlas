# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical documentation that is no longer current but preserved for reference.

## Why These Documents Were Archived

These documents were moved here during the documentation consolidation in January 2026 because they:

- Represent one-time reports or audits
- Document implementation work that is now complete and stable
- Contain information that has been superseded by newer documentation
- Are session summaries from specific dates
