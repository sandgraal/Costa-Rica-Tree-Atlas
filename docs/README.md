## 📦 Archive

Historical documentation and implementation details have been moved to `docs/archive/`:

- **one-time-reports/** - Audits, reviews, and post-mortems
- **implementation-details/** - Over-documented technical details (use the code instead!)
- **[Archive README](./archive/README.md)** - Full archive index

**Philosophy:** The code is the documentation. We keep only what's truly useful for contributors.
